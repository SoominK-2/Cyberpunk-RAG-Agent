V, an alias forValerie/Vincent,[3]is amercenaryinvolved in a series of singular events during the year2077, which toppled the balance of power inNight City.
V is the playable protagonist ofCyberpunk 2077. Their gender, appearance, voice, attributes, perks, andLifepathsare all customizable and have an impact on the storyline.[4]
Thecharacter customization systemprocess starts with the player either selecting a preset character or creating a custom one. When customizing the character, the player can select a gender and then customize the rest of the character, which can include depictions of breasts and genitalia. Options also include picking between a masculine and feminine voice.[5]
The player then selects V'sLifepathbackground, by choosingNomad,Streetkid, orCorpo. Each Lifepath will begin in a different starting location aroundNight City, and V will be in a different place in life overall.
The player will have a different introductory questline (The Nomad,The Streetkid, orThe Corpo-Rat) and equipment, which will be connected to V's specific origin story and will be introduced to the character differently. Lifepaths will stretch the entirety of the game, and not only will it open up different dialogue options, but you will also unlock a specific side quest based off your Lifepath.
After the introductory questlines, a compilation cutscene will lead into the last two quests of the prologue —The Rescue, a quest that will lead to Act 1; andPractice Makes Perfect, an optional tutorial about some of the video game mechanics. At this point, the game follows a similar narrative line.
Depending on the chosenLifepath, V will have one out of three backgrounds which all lead to the same narrative path.
If V has theNomadLifepath:
If V has theStreetkidlifepath:
If V has theCorpolifepath:
V stayed with Jackie for six months, doingmercenaryjobs together while improving theirstreet cred. Eventually, V managed to save enough money to rent an apartment of their own inMegabuilding H10.
Around the last week of April 2077,[2]after completinga jobforWakako Okada, V and Jackie were contacted by another fixer namedDexter DeShawn. They, along withNetrunnerT-Bug, were hired to break intoKonpeki Plazaand steal aRelicfromYorinobu ArasakaforEvelyn Parker. V undertook preparation for the heist, meeting with Parker to locate the device and retrieving aFlatheadfrom theMaelstromgang to assist them.
After finishing planning at theAfterlife, V and the crew undertook the heist and successfully retrieved the Relic from Konpeki Plaza. However, they were forced to hide when Yorinobu returned to his apartment and met with his father,Saburo Arasaka, in the room and murdered him. With security increased in the building, T-Bug was quickly discovered and killed by Arasaka's netrunners remotely, moments after breaching the door security. V and Jackie tried to move towards a ladder to escape but an Arasaka's drone found them and shot at them. They jumped off and fell down through a glass roof, leaving Jackie seriously wounded and the container of the Relic damaged, causing the Relic's integrity to drop. To avoid further damage to the Relic, Jackie slotted the shard into his neural interface. Jackie and V escaped on the Delamain cab, after being chased by Arasaka drones. On the way toNo-Tell Motel, Jackie succumbed to his critical wounds. Before Jackie breathed his last, he used up his last effort to slot the Relic into V to keep it safe.
At the rendezvous point inside the No-Tell Motel, DeShawn shot V in the head and dumped V's body inthe landfillto cover his track, with the Relic remaining slotted in V's neural interface.
However, the Relic successfully resurrected V sometime later, and V tried to crawl out of the garbage. Located by Saburo's ex-bodyguardGoro Takemura, they were brought back to Night City and toViktor Vektor's clinic. Whilst recovering there, V learned that the Relic was overriding their consciousness with an engram ofJohnny Silverhand, and that they had only a short time left to live. Misty then brings V back to their apartment to rest. Later that night, the engram of Johnny Silverhand starts assaulting V, demanding them to commit suicide. Despite some difficulty and struggle, V succeeds in taking the pills that Misty gave them. Meeting with Goro, V was asked to help testify to Saburo's heir,Hanako, and expose Yorinobu's crime. At the same time, they decided to investigate various leads into removing the Relic, including Evelyn and its creatorAnders Hellman.
With help fromJudy Álvarez, V located Evelyn and learned that she was initially hired by theVoodoo Boysto steal the Relic, though only for Silverhand's engram. Meeting withPlacide, they arranged to help them bypass theBlackwalland contactAlt Cunningham, a legendary netrunner and Johnny's former girlfriend. Through Alt, V learned that they could extract the engram throughSoulkillerand rewrite it with their consciousness, though only within Arasaka'sMikoshisystem. After contactingRogue Amendiares, V learned that Hellman was attempting to defect toKang Tao. Working withPanam Palmerand theAldecaldos, they ambushed his convoy and retrieved him. Whilst interrogating Hellman, V learned that the Relic was permanently connected to their neural system, making the process impossible to undo. Afterwards, V called Takemura to follow up with his own interrogation and unfinished business.
V and Goro met withSandayu Oda, Hanako's bodyguard, to inform him of Yorinobu's betrayal. When he refused to believe them, they gradually decided to contact Hanako during Yorinobu's memorial parade and began making preparations to do so. After they dealt with the security forces and Oda, Goro was forced to kidnap Hanako and had V meet with her. After telling her what they witnessed, they were attacked by Arasaka forces led byAdam Smasher, though V managed to escape the ambush. Shortly afterwards, V was contacted by Hanako and arranged a meeting atEmbers. During it, they learned that Mikoshi was located underArasaka Tower.
During the meeting, the Relic began to malfunction, forcing V to leave it early. With Silverhand taking control, they were taken to Victor's clinic and learned that the Relic's process was almost complete.
Given some time to be alone, V and Johnny contemplated whatoptionsthey had. Finally, V made their last call and decided what they were going to do.
If V accepted Hanako's offer:
If V followed Johnny's advice or if V chose to assault the tower all alone:
If V decided to call Panam for help:
If V decided to call Reed for help:Reedwill arrange for an AV to take V to Langley. During the Journey, V and Johnny will have a final conversation before the former is injected anesthesia, causing them to fall unconscious. V will wake up in hospital being greeted by Reed. Reed explains that V has been in a coma for two years, and while the surgery was a success, the damage done to V's nervous system means that their body can no longer handle most forms of cyberware. V demands to go back to Night City. V has the option to call some of their friends first but discovers most of them have moved on with their lives, some even leaving Night City all together. After V calls the nurse, they return to Night City. V will take a Delemain cab toMisty's Esoterica, which is now aZetatechNetwork Clinic. After Viktor confirms V's diagnosis, another client of his walks in and V leaves. While walking back to Delemains cab, V is accosted by a pair of thugs. Without their combat implants, V is unable to fight back and severely beaten. They are found byMisty. After a short conversation about V's future, Misty informs them that she's leaving Night City for good, but that V should come visit her should they ever find themselves in Poland. After walking Misty to her ride, V looks up and gives a slight smile and, accepting they must now live as a normal civilian, disappears into a crowd.
If V decides to "put everything to rest":
The character of V was unveiled at the E3 2018 show, whereCD Projekt REDrevealed the game for the first time since 2013. Players were going to find themselves in the role of V, an up and coming cyberpunk in Night City. Rather than having a pre-defined character, similar toGeralt of Riviafrom theWitcherfranchise, CDPR elected to allow players to define their own character.
CDPR designed the game so that its content and gameplay experience would be identical for both genders. However, V's dialogue, mannerisms and how others treat them may vary depending on which one you pick.
Male V went through multiple redesigns over the course of development. By looking at the various trailers and gameplay footage, you can see each new design CDPR went with for that time.

Johnny Silverhand, bornRobert John Linder,[1][Twitter 1]was a famous and influentialrockerboyand lead singer of the bandSamuraibefore its breakup in 2008.[2]A military veteran who defined the rockerboy movement as it is known today, Silverhand was the most prominent figure who fought against the corruptAmerican governmentandmegacorporations, often being described as a terrorist because of this. Despite being charismatic and quite the charmer, he was also known to be irrational, impulsive, and manipulative.[3]
Silverhand got his nickname from the silvery bionic left arm he had implanted after losing his actual arm in theSecond Central American War. Most probably one of the early victims ofcyberpsychosisas a result, he then became very temperamental and "on the edge."[Reddit 2]He is described in one interview as having been driven by "dedication and ambitions, but at the end of the day, he doesn't care much for the people around him as long as they are used to accomplish his goals."[4][citation needed]
Eventually, Silverhand was killed byAdam Smasherduring theNight City Holocauston August 20th, 2023. However, his consciousness was saved as anengramand stored after his encounter with Smasher, but just prior to his bodily death. The engram is not Silverhand's actual consciousness, but instead a digital replication of his personality which, when it was copied onto theRelic2.0 in2077, it was engineered to overwrite itself onto its host like a virus.
Robert John Linder was born in College Station,Texas, on November 16th, 1988.[1][Twitter 1][Twitter 2]Growing up, he became a massive fan ofWendy O. Williamsand came to consider her the toughest rockergirl ever.[5]
John enlisted in the military as a teenager after lying about his real age, and it didn't take long for him to see action.[Twitter 3]He was sent toNicaraguato participate in theSecond Central American Warof 2003. While in the war, John's life was purportedly saved by a friend who died protecting him.
Perpetrated by a corrupt and manipulativeUS Government, the conflict was devastating. When the government's secrets were exposed, many of the American soldiers dropped their banners and fought back by deserting the military. In response, however, the government used its influence to launch a powerful propaganda campaign against these former soldiers and convinced the American public to despise them as deserters.
John was one of the soldiers who decided he would no longer fight in the corrupt war that ultimately led to him losing his arm and his friend. He left forNight City, staying at theHotel Pistis Sophiafor a whole month after his arrival.[6]The military and the war had changed his life forever.
John changed his name to Johnny Silverhand, with his new surname referencing the bionic arm he had implanted to replace his left arm.[7]Johnny thus began his mission of rebellion and exposing corruption by starting a rock band that would eventually be known asSamurai.[8][3]He started this band with his friend,Kerry Eurodyne, originally only playing in backstreet clubs.
Johnny's and Kerry's first ever gig was in theRed Dirt, a small bar in Night City. At some point in 2003, while they were playing in a bar calledRainbow Cadenza, a producer namedJack Mastersdiscovered them and signed them to Universal Recording. Samurai was comprised of the co-founders, Johnny and Kerry, as well asDenny,Nancy Hartley, andHenry.
Johnny's music became revolutionary, kickstarting the rockerboy movement and becoming an overnight sensation. He, along with Samurai itself, rose to the top of the US music charts in record time. Despite their success, however, Samurai struggled to maintain as personal issues rose to the surface.
During this time, Samurai's keyboard player, Nancy, was in an abusive relationship. She reached a point in the relationship where she could no longer stand the abuse, and she pushed her boyfriend out of a window. After theNCPDdiscovered the body, Nancy was arrested and taken to prison.
Without Nancy, Samurai struggled to stay together and finally split up in 2008.[3]Johnny was still one of the most popular musicians at the time, however, and he planned to use his star power to launch a solo career in which to continue pushing his anti-corporation and anti-government message. By then, DBS Music wanted to sign Johnny so desperately that they blackmailed him, threatening to reveal his true identity as a deserter of the Second Central American Conflict.
In defiance of DBS Music's attempts to blackmail him, Johnny instead signed once again with Universal Music. He then released a complete album entitled "SINS of Your Brothers," in which he admitted to being a deserter and revealed all the terrible actions the government had ordered its military to carry out. The album was wildly successful and changed public perception on what it meant to be a deserter.[3]
Johnny continued his rebellious campaign into the 2010s. During this time, he performed his famous free benefit concert inJapantownto call attention to the brutal methods the NCPD used to quell the Homeless Riots.[9]Johnny's relationship withRogue Amendiaresalso ended at some point in 2011 after she discovered that he had cheated on her.[1][10]
In2012, both Johnny and Kerry bought theGrand Illusionclub in Night City. As they didn't make the purchase public, it wasn't known by many. At some point later, driven by memories and using their influence, both rockers begun an open mic night on Thursdays which was regularly attended by anexecutiveofUniversal Records, the label under which both men recorded.[11]
After giving a concert atThe Hammeron August 4th in2013, Johnny re-connected with his former girlfriend,Alt Cunningham. When the two went for a walk together that night, they were ambushed by a group of thugs hired byArasaka. The thugs injured Johnny severely and kidnapped Alt as a helpless Johnny watched them take off in a van.
On the 5th of August, 2013, Johnny gathered a strike team consisting of his ex-girlfriend andsolo, Rogue,mediareporterLyle Thompson, and thenomadleader of theAldecaldos,Santiago, in order to infiltrateArasaka Towerin Night City to save Alt. As a diversion, he called in a favor from all the members of his old band. Samurai gathered together to perform an entirely free show directly in front of the complex.
Samurai's performance led to a riot aimed at the tower as troops were called in to control the situation. Unbeknownst to Johnny at this time, Arasaka had kidnapped Alt specifically to force her to develop a new version of theSoulkillersoftware she had written forITS.[1]In a panic reaction to the assault,Toshiro Haradaused Soulkiller on Alt while the assault took place, trapping her inside the Arasaka mainframe.[citation needed]
As Johnny and his team infiltrated the tower, Alt attempted to find a way to escape the Arasaka mainframe and return to her body. The team reached the room where Toshiro andAkirawere keeping Alt, and as a rage-fueled Johnny came upon Toshiro standing over Alt, he shot Toshiro dead. Johnny then disconnected Alt from the netrunning chair she was plugged into, assuming she had died as he gathered her still warm body in his arms.
Behind the wall of monitors, a disembodied Alt screamed out to Johnny, but he could not hear her.[10][12]
After the assault on the tower, Johnny and Santiago left Night City and went into hiding with the Aldecaldos nomad family. In2015, the two finally returned to the USA fromMexico City.[13]Upon returning to Night City, Silverhand played a free benefit concert inLake Parkin order to bring attention to the brutal methods that the NCPD had used to quell the2014Homeless Riots. This made him gain the respect ofthe Pack, and Johnny occasionally went to their aid if they called for him.[14]Little is known of what Johnny did during this time, but it was around 2015 that a firefighter by the name ofSamantha Stevenssaved him from a fire in one of hisstudios.[15][16][17]
Around2020, Johnny gave an interview in which he reminisced about a girl he had fallen for. She had told him she was born inMiamiaround2004, as she could still remember the destruction ofTampa. Johnny mentioned that she had abiosculptsmile and blue Teknics 2350eyes, though he did not care how much of her was "real."[18]
On August 20th, 2023, Johnny andMorgan Blackhand, alongside Rogue,Shaitan, Thompson, andSpider Murphy, led aMilitechassaultteam on theArasaka Towersin Night City, with the intention of destroying the towers with a mini nuke and ultimately ending theFourth Corporate War.[19]Johnny had another reason for going back to the towers, however: he wanted to findAlt Cunningham. There were more than a few obstacles in the way of this personal objective.
After successfully liberating Alt, Johnny's team was pinned down in the Soulkiller labs by Arasaka forces and Adam Smasher. Johnny, who had barely managed to find cover, was conflicted on what to do next. He felt that during his first attack on the towers, he had failed Alt, and he was determined this time not to fail her again.
With a Militech SMG in one hand and hisMalorian Armsin the other, Johnny resolved to leave cover, shouting at and provoking Smasher while emptying his ammo into the borg. Smasher, surprised at Silverhand's audacity, whipped around and fired his auto-shotgun at Silverhand, ripping the rockerboy in half. This allowed Shaitan to immobilize the Arasaka borg, granting the rest of the team the chance to escape.[19][20]
Spider Murphy tried to reach Johnny, but she was stopped by Rogue, who told her he was gone. Spider instead reached inside her jacket to pull out a data slug Alt had given to her long ago, and as she whispered to Johnny that she was sorry, she inserted the chip into the back of the dying rockerboy's skull. She then reached for her data suitcase, quickly realizing it had been destroyed in the crossfire, and then escaped with Rogue knowing that both Johnny andRache Bartmosswould one day be avenged.[20]
Johnny's engram as coded on the Relic in 2077 holds a different tale of the events. In Johnny's version of the story, he escaped the initial fight with Smasher and attempted to reach the helicopter where Rogue was waiting, but was again cut off by Smasher. Johnny was then presumed gunned down by the borg and dead, but was instead recovered and detained by Arasaka.
According to the engram, while in the custody of Arasaka, Johnny was interrogated first by the corp's security and then later bySaburo Arasakahimself with the assistance of atechie. He was subjected to the Soulkiller program, in which his consciousness was scanned and stored on an engram as his physical body died. He was then allegedly buried under concrete in thederelict oil fieldsjust outside of Night City.[21]
Despite there being no body to inter, a niche was dedicated to Johnny's memory at theNorth Oak Columbarium. His epitaph, which uses his real name, reads: "Robert John Linder: Son of a bitch who never gave up. A legend among legends."[22]
Not long after the 2023 Night City Holocaust, firefighter and Johnny Silverhand fan, Samantha Stevens, accessed theHot Zoneafter receiving a request fromAngel. There, Samantha recovered anon-detonated mini-nukefrom a wrecked bunker of the destroyed towers, later tossing its contents intoDel Coronado Bay. After finding Johnny's body among the ruins, she placed it into the nuke crate to preserve it.
At some point, Samantha also recovered several of Johnny's possessions, including one of his Malorian Arms and hisPorsche. Along with the bomb case, she hid these items in hergaragesomewhere in Night City, where she protected and took care of them for years.
During theTime of the Red, after encountering a group of edgerunners who were trying to find anunreleased songby Silverhand, Samantha tasked the group with transporting the crate containing Johnny's body toLos Alamos LabsinNew Mexico. Before they left, Samantha took one of them, amercenaryknown asZara, aside and gifted her the Malorian. She intimated to Zara that the owner was never going to use it again, adding that Zara seemed the right person to carry it for him.
The group of edgerunners managed to deliver the crate to Angel in New Mexico. After opening the crate, she whispered "Hello, my love."[17]
By the2070s, Johnny was a controversial legend of Night City with a multitude of rumors surrounding him. The only certainty was his musical career both as a member of Samurai and later as a solo rockerboy. Stories told about him included a Samurai tour in 2020,[23]ashardsaying Johnny was sleeping with both Kerry and Henry to keep them in the band, or that he was the terrorist that dropped the bomb on the Arasaka Towers in 2023.
At some point prior to 2077, Johnny Silverhand's engram was copied onto a prototype version of the Relic know as Relic 2.0. This device was stolen byYorinobu Arasakaand stored within a secure vault inKonpeki Plazain an attempt by Yorinobu to bait his father, Saburo Arasaka, out into public. The engram and its location were uncovered by theVoodoo Boys, who planned to steal and use it establish contact with Alt and pass through theBlackwall.
The Voodoo Boys hiredEvelyn Parkerto record abraindanceof the room and determine its security measures as well as the location of the Relic. Parker instead decided to betray the Voodoo Boys and steal the device for herself to sell toNetWatch. Using fixerDexter DeShawn, she hired mercenariesVandJackie Wellesto steal the Relic from Yorinobu's room.
The two mercenaries were nearly successful in stealing the Relic without getting caught, but their heist instead quickly fell apart after the unexpected murder of Saburo by his son. During the mercenaries' improvised escape, the Relic's storage case was damaged. To ensure the Relic's preservation, a wounded Jackie Welles inserted it into his shard slot, then later placed it into V's hands as he lay dying of his wounds in theDelamain Cab.
Immediately after Jackie's death outside theNo-Tell Motel, V inserted the Relic into their own shard slot. Because of this, the Relic activated upon V's murder at the hands of DeShawn, preserving V's life and finally awaking Johnny's engram. It then began transferring the engram to V's brain, overwriting the mercenary's consciousness with Johnny's digital personality, just as it was programmed to do.
Initially attacking V in a bid to take over V's mind and body, Johnny eventually decided to cooperate with V to ensure his own survival or at least ensure the Relic's retrieval from V's head. Johnny appeared to V on numerous occasions, often either to provide advice to V or to offer his thoughts on their respective situations. Johnny also attempted to take control of V's body on a handful of occasions, and the Relic itself placed V into glimpses of Johnny's memories, including his attempt to save Alt in 2013 and his final attack on the Arasaka Towers in 2023. Johnny could have also reconnected with old friends like Rogue or Kerry, with the engram mentioning in one dialogue branch in "Holdin' On" he never slept with Kerry because he's a man.
If V took Hanako's offer inNocturne Op55N1:
If V asked Panam for help inNocturne Op55N1:
If V lets Johnny go with Rogue inNocturne Op55N1:
If V and Johnny go on a suicide run in(Don't Fear) The Reaper:
Silverhand released six albums between 2009 and 2020.[24]
The release dates of some of these albums and songs is inconsistent within theCyberpunkseries.
After leaving the military, Johnny Silverhand became determined to speak the truth of the corruption and oppression of many entities that held positions of power in the world. His music became an extension of his feelings for the public to hear, though none of it ever made him feel better. He made it his goal to spark rebellion in the people, opening their eyes to the reality of their oppression and galvanizing them to punch up against those he believed were their oppressors.
Johnny harbored a constant hatred for much the world around him:Night City, theNUSA, thepolice, corps, and most of all,Arasaka. He concentrated most of his anger and hatred on Arasaka, on two occasions carrying out attacks on Arasaka's HQ and becoming so obsessed with the megacorporation that his friends would criticize him for his extreme determination. To Johnny, Arasaka represented corporate colonialism at its worst, perceiving that megacorps would consume all the land and take complete control of people's lives, and he feared that humanity had already lost its freedom.
Despite his self-proclaimed fight for freedom, Johnny lacked empathy for most people. If he needed to kill to prove his point, he would do it without hesitation, never deviating from his goal of total rebellion. Garnering a reputation as a terrorist and anarchist, Johnny believed that taking control back from the corporate powers meant doing whatever it took, even dying as a legend to spread the same of spark rebellion in others.
PerAlt Cunningham, Johnny's memories as encoded in his engram in 2077 are not accurate to what truly happened during the events of 2013 and 2023:
Mike Pondsmithhas elaborated on the verity of Johnny's memories encountered through his engram inCyberpunk 2077:
V's affinity with Johnny does not seem to have any major impact in the game. However, the secret ending can only be unlocked via specific dialogue choices duringChippin' In, which also increases affinity. StartingCyberpunk 2077:Phantom Libertywith an old save may cause a bug that shows the wrong Affinity entry, some of which may include information about later quests.
It appears to be symbolic of how much control Johnny has of V's body, as indicated by a 100% during the Temperance ending and a 0% in the Tower ending. However, certain percentages (such as the 90% in the Sun ending) instead imply an alignment with Johnny's ideals, since Johnny has exited V's mind in this ending.
DuringNever Fade Away, players can espy the following information onMilt Nauman'scomputer:[1]
Note:This information may not be completely accurate, as it is found only in Johnny's flashback of 2013 (see above).
Johnny wears a pair of military dog tags containing information about his past. Johnny'sengramcan be seen wearing the tags, and he guides V to the real tags during the final phase ofTapeworm:
Johnny states that these tags belonged to a fellow army companion who died during the war. However, he most likely no longer considers himself Linder after seeing the horrors caused by megacorps, having become Silverhand (physically and figuratively).[28]
Early development trailers and gameplay demos showed Johnny Silverhand as a selectable childhood hero, which was the first iteration of the lifepath system. Among other options wereMorgan BlackhandandSaburo Arasaka. During the gameplay reveal, there were hints that Silverhand had lived until the year 2076 before either supposedly dying or disappearing, with graffiti and radio broadcasts telling different stories of his demise.
During the E3 2018 trailer, several pieces of graffiti can be seen asking "Where's Johnny?", alluding to false reports of Silverhand's death. In the E3 gameplay reveal,Vcan be heard listening to Silverhand's version of the song, "Chippin' In," as well as wearing a Samurai jacket. This jacket is revealed in the game as areplica of Johnny's jacket.
At the Microsoft E3 2019 conference,Keanu Reeveswas revealed as both the voice actor and model for Silverhand. Silverhand shows up at the end of the 2019 cinematic trailer to help V after V is left for dead in a landfill. In posterior interviews, it was revealed that Reeves had been approached to play Silverhand a year prior to the announcement.
It was revealed that while Silverhand is voiced and modeled after Keanu Reeves, Johnny's parts in theSamuraisoundtrack are sung by Dennis Lyxzen fromRefused.
Johnny Silverhand acts as V's guide to the city, accompanying them for most of the game. Throughout the game, V is haunted by the "digital ghost" of Silverhand, which confirms he is physically dead. Johnny Silverhand first appears at the start of Act 2, commenting on the player's actions through voiceover and occasionally appearing in-game as a hologram. Solving the mystery of Johnny Silverhand's digital ghost is a core aspect of the main plot.[35]

Jackie Wellesis the deuteragonist of Act 1 inCyberpunk 2077.
AmercfromHeywood, together withV, he aimed to become a legend inNight City. Jackie was known to value friendship, loyalty, and family above all else. He dreamed of living a life of luxury and providing for his own family, a dream that remained elusive for the impatient merc and that would ultimately never materialize.[2]
InCyberpunk 2077, Jackie is one of V's first contacts, quickly becoming V's partner and accompanying V on a handful of early jobs in the game.
Jackie was raised by both of his parents, though hisfatherwas a violent alcoholic, often getting drunk and beating hiswifeand Jackie mercilessly with his belt. When Jackie became old and strong enough, he finally returned the favor, hospitalizing his father and threatening to kill the old man if he ever returned home. Raúl left and was never seen again, but Jackie kept his father's belt, planning to use it on the man if he ever returned.
Jackie grew up in the same neighborhood asMisty Olszewski. The two saw a lot of each other, though they never got together in their younger years.
At the age of 15, Jackie got on his first bike, and from then on, he tinkered with any bikes he could get his hands on. Early on, he joined theValentinosalongsideGustavo Ortaand the two became fast friends. However, after sustaining a near-fatal gunshot wound at 19 in a gang war firefight with theMaelstrom, Jackie decided to leave the Valentinos for the sake of his mother, though he remained on good terms with the gang and withPadre.[5]
In2076, Jackie began dating Misty. His mother disapproved of Misty, preferring his ex-girlfriend, Camilla, but Jackie was unfazed, even attempting to understand and reciprocate her spiritualism by making a mandala in his garage.[5]
Sometime afterDavid Martinez's death, Welles was inEl Coyote Cojowith friends, where he answered the questions of a group of edgerunners crew about the Valentinos memberDalton Estevan-Luis. Later that day, he went on a date with Misty.[6]
Later that same year, Jackie metV, the circumstances of their meeting being determined by thelifepaththe player chooses. Based on this choice, Jackie and V will have had a different introduction, each one seeing Jackie as either being or becoming a friend to V during the prologue:
If V has theNomadlifepath:
If V has theStreetkidlifepath:
If V has theCorpolifepath:
By late April2077, six months after the events of the prologue, Jackie and V had established themselves as reliable mercs. At some point they partnered with netrunnerT-Bug, who guides them in the latest of many jobs; rescuingSandra DorsettfromScavs. At the suggestion of T-Bug, Jackie and V were recruited byDexter DeShawn(at the behest ofEvelyn Parker) to steal a prototypeRelicfromYorinobu Arasakacontaining an engram ofJohnny Silverhand.
DuringThe Pickup, Jackie accompanied V to the Maelstrom stronghold, theAll Foods Factory, to acquire aMilitech Flathead, which was essential for the seemingly impossible heist. After everything was set in place for the heist, Jackie and V were finally admitted into the famedAfterlife, where Jackie intimated to the club's bartender,Claire Russell, that he wanteda cocktail named after himif he ever managed to become a Night City legend. The drink would contain "A shot of vodka, lime juice, ginger beer and, most importantly... a splash of love."
That night, Jackie and V held their briefing with T-Bug and Dex on how to steal the Relic fromKonpeki Plaza. Although the mercs successfully infiltrated Yorinobu's room and retrieved the Relic,The Heisttook a drastic turn when Yorinobu killed hisfatherduring a surprise visit by the elder Arasaka. Jackie and V managed to escape the hotel, but Jackie is severely injured and bleeds to death in theDelamain Cabbefore they could arrive at theNo-Tell Motelto meet with Dex; just before dying, he gives theRelicchip to V, entrusting them complete the delivery in his stead.
The fate of Jackie's body was decided by V:
If Jackie's body was sent to his family or if Delamain was told to wait for V (unlocksHeroes):
If Jackie's body was sent to Viktor:
Jackie played a major role in the 48-minuteCyberpunk 2077gameplay reveal, serving asV's partner in the job,Breaking Through, wherein V is tasked with rescuingSandra Dorsettfrom theScavengersbefore they harvest her body. In the gameplay reveal, Jackie was shown to have aQuadra V-Tech, which V would eventually come to own and drive in the final release of the game.
In the 2019E3cinematic trailer, Jackie accompanies V on a mission fromDexter DeShawnto steal a special cybernetic augmentation chip. Although the chip is successfully retrieved, V botches the mission by drawing too much attention to the theft, and Jackie is presumably killed in the ensuing firefight, leaving V heartbroken and wracked with guilt.
In a #REDstreams livestream, senior quest designer Patrick Mills noted that in a very early version of the game's story, Jackie was originally supposed to be an annoyance towards the player, and was the original cause for the failure ofThe Heist.[13]

Judy Álvarezis a skilledbraindancetechieand a member ofthe Mox. She has her ownapartmentin northeasternKabuki,Watson. Judy is a possibleromanceoption forVinCyberpunk 2077.
Judy was born on November 27,2052[4][5], inLaguna Bend, a small town in the rural outskirts ofNight City. Her father was never around, and her mother died when she was just a child. She still has a photo of her, but can barely remember her mother anymore. Judy was raised instead by her grandparents. Her grandfather was atechieand taught her all that she knows. She also loved to hear the stories he told.Ainara, her grandmother, was temperamental, something Judy herself seemingly inherited.
While growing up in her hometown, Judy used to hang out with the other kids, sometimes playing street hockey on rollerblades or "MaxTac and psychos", though they often mocked her for not having her parents around and being poor. She also liked to eat the burgers ofFlo's Diner, the only eatery in her town.
Around 2057, Judy hidJenni Chapman's doll as she thought that only losers played with them. What Judy really wanted, though, was for Jenni to notice her, and she proposed to help her find the missing doll. In the end neither of those things occurred.
Despite not being religious, Judy sometimes visited her town's church — a building she always thought looked old and out of place — simply because it was just there. Once, she snuck inside of it when no one was around and stood at the altar, wondering what went through the priest's mind when he looked at the people, asking herself how he could read their minds and know everything about them. She then screamed at the top of her lungs to check the acoustics of the building, but when the echo returned, it scared her and she ran away. Judy thought it was all the guilt she felt for having a crush on Jenni, and after screaming it out, it had bounced back to her.[8]
When the area of Laguna Bend was bought out byNC Dam Ltd.some time around 2062, the residents were forced to vacate as the corporation had plans to transform the region into areservoir. Although there were protests in the months that followed, the residents were eventually outed from their homes. Judy and her grandparents moved into a rentalapartmentin Night City, but her grandparents hated the metropolis and left a couple of years later. They moved further north toOregonwhile Judy stayed and made the apartment her own.[8]
When Judy was sixteen years old, she was convicted and detained for stealing a fire truck. In reality, Judy had not stolen it but instead found it abandoned in a scrapyard. She decided to fix it up — which took her half a year — and then the police busted her on her first ride. They did not believe Judy and proceeded to detain her. Many years later, Judy tried to get some kind of compensation for what she thought was "an unlawful juvenile arrest." She contacted a lawyer in hopes she could help her win a compensation from theCity Council, but she dismissed Judy stating it was something very difficult to achieve and not worth the trouble. Thinking that the woman didn't believe her either, Judy dropped the case.[1]
Judy worked as abraindancetechnician atCloudsfor a time. There she met most of thedolls, includingEvelyn Parker,Tom Caldera,[9]andMaiko Maeda, the latter with whom she eventually begun a relationship.[10]Judy also helped Maiko jump up the ranks by tweaking the stats on her doll-chip, not only to help her but also hoping things would change for the better for both of them.[11]
At some point, Judy left Clouds and found work atLizzie's Baras a braindance technician and editor, joiningthe Moxin the process.[12]She thought they could change the lives of the people in Night City for the better.[10]Judy installed her equipment on the bar's basement on behalf ofSusie "Q", the Mox leader. While working at Lizzie's, Judy maintained contact with the dolls at Clouds, especially with Evelyn — whose best friend she had become — and Maiko.[1]
Since Maiko's promotion, Judy's relationship with her had started to become more difficult, but still she visited her girlfriend at her office in Clouds whenever she could. Judy was jealous of how much time Maiko spent around other girls at Clouds, and one day she finally mentioned it to Maiko, but got over it hoping to spend some interesting time with Maiko later. First though, Judy had to attend the anniversary ofLizzie Borden's death and the Mox's creation.[11]
One day, when Judy was trying to get into Maiko's office the security didn't let her. After going home, Judy messaged her girlfriend and told her about it. Maiko tried to excuse herself saying it was due to "procedures", but Judy knew it was her call since the security had contacted her right before that. Maiko asked Judy to cool down, as this could mean trouble for her, stating she had to keep up some semblance of professionalism, and didn't want to lose her position after how much she had endured to be there. This caused an argument between the two in which Judy said that things were as bad as before, but not for Maiko as she was doing just fine. Maiko responded that she was doing it for them both, that she was thinking about their future together, and didn't understand why that made Judy so angry. Judy realized that their perspectives on the world had changed, and she had been left behind. Maiko was just looking for more power and Judy was ashamed she hadn't noticed sooner. Judy simply hoped that when Night City chewed up and spit Maiko out, she would still have something of her old self left. Some time after the argument, Maiko asked Judy to give her time to think about everything, and to give herself time to cool down, but for Judy it was over.[11]
Some time later, Judy asked Maiko to go to her apartment and take back her clothes, something Maiko didn't care about and asked Judy to get rid of them. Despite this, Maiko wanted to go to Judy's apartment to talk things out, as she felt everything had escalated too quickly and maybe it was just a misunderstanding and that things didn't have to end that way, at least not so suddenly. Judy didn't buy it. There was nothing else to talk about, stating Maiko was doing what she always did — buttering her with promises she didn't actually wanted to keep. Judy said she would simply leave her clothes on front of the apartment's door, and would not open it if Maiko tried to knock. An angered Maiko answered Judy could toss her clothes out of the window if she wanted, as she didn't care and would not visit her. Judy sarcastically replied it was nice Maiko could afford to toss her clothes, and if any of hers were on Maiko's place she could leave them on the street for people who needed them. As for her ex-girlfriend's clothes, since they were expensive, Judy stated she would rather burn them.[11]
After a long time since her last talk, Evelyn contacted Judy, asking if she was still cooped in Susie "Q"'s basement and if she was still dating Maiko. Judy told her one of those things was still true. Parker had messaged her because she needed help with a small but important favor. She needed to have avirtuscrolled, and knew Judy was the best. In exchange, she promised her a life free of work where Judy could just focus on her art. Evelyn asked to at least meet, and wondered where she could find her. Judy simply answered "in Susie Q's basement".[1]
Some time after Evelyn had explained what she needed from Judy, the two had some drinks at Lizzie's Bar while waiting for Evelyn's contact to appear. Once they did, Judy finished her drink and went back to the basement. Later, Evelyn appeared with her contact and introducedVto her friend. Judy helped V to tune up for a braindance and showed them how to edit it. Afterwards they proceeded to scroll Evelyn's recording to find her objective. Once done, Judy gave V the portable device they had used for the scrolling, as it already had V's profile and in case someone could trace its use to her. She also commented that whatever it was Evelyn and V were planning to do it would kill them both, expressing she didn't want to have any trouble for helping them. Evelyn reassured Judy that there would be none.[13]
The failed heist V and Evelyn were involved in had disastrous consequences for Evelyn, who would be cyber-attacked, raped, and eventually sold toScavengers. After following a lead toripperdocFingers, V and Judy were able to procure anillegal braindancefromLenny Nerocontaining information on Evelyn's whereabouts. However, after locating and rescuing Evelyn, she committed suicide in Judy's bathtub, the burden of the trauma she experienced having been too much to bear. Judy immediately contacted V, who came and helped her move Evelyn onto Judy's bed so that the police would pick her up in a more dignified location. At some point later, Judy asked V to accompany her to Clouds and talk with her ex-girlfriendMaiko— the club's unofficial manager — about Evelyn's fate and the club's current status, as well as to confront (and optionally kill) her rapistOswald Forrest, henchman of theTyger Clawsand formal manager of Clouds.[14][15][16][17][18]
Soon after, Judy asked V to join her in her apartment to have pizza and discuss a plan with Clouds' dollsTomandRoxanneas well as Maiko to dispose ofHiromi Sato— owner of the club — and take over Clouds from the Tyger Claws. As V experienced arelicmalfunction, this is also the first opportunity that they could tell Judy about it before crashing on her couch. Later, as V and Maiko confronted Hiromi and his Tyger bossesJun AzegamiandMarcus Ichida, Maiko, who had been playing a double game, proposed a new deal: Taking over Clouds herself under Tyger Claw protection by ousting Hiromi.[19][20]
If V accepts Maiko's deal and her bribe at the end ofPisces(will NOT unlockPyramid Song):
If V accepts Maiko's deal but not her bribe at the end of Pisces (will unlock Pyramid Song):
If V rejects Maiko's deal at the end of Pisces (will unlock Pyramid Song):
If V has a feminine body type and voice (regardless of genitalia) Judy is a potentialromanceoption.
Although Evelyn introduces V to Judy already duringThe Information, she remains distant and somewhat distrustful until V helps her to rescue Evelyn inDouble Life. Some time later,Both Sides, Nowis initiated as a shocked Judy calls V, asking to come to her place immediately as Evelyn committed suicide. Tragically, it is not until this event that Judy begins to show some affection towards V, mentioning that she is actually glad V now has Evelyn's old smoke case. V can help Judy more duringEx-Factorby accompanying her to talk withMaiko, and optionally taking revenge for Evelyn by killingWoodmanor by convincing her it's not worth it. Later duringTalkin' 'bout a Revolution, V can choose to stay the night on Judy's couch after arelicmalfunction. She texts V the next day, asking if things are better, leaving them breakfast, and saying that she had a great time the previous night thanks to V.
However, up until the following mission,Pisces, none of the optional mission objectives and dialogue choices mentioned above are relevant to romance Judy. Even alienating Judy by killing Maiko or accepting her deal (but not her bribe) at the end of Pisces will still unlockPyramid Songand retain the romantic option (seeBiography). However, it is only by rejecting Maiko's deal while also keeping her alive that Judy will reward V (only female) with a goodbye cheek kiss at the end of Pisces.
Judy can be fully romanced duringPyramid Song(seeabove). While several flirtatious remarks are possible earlier in the mission, e.g., about how good Judy looks in her diving gear, the key scene is when V comforts her in the bathroom and Judy says that she wanted this to be "just our day" (only for female V).
If V chooses not to touch or kiss Judy inPyramid Song:
If V kisses Judy duringPyramid Song(female V only):
After this, Judy can be found in her apartment, greeting V with "I was just thinking of you. And before you ask — no, you weren't wearing clothes." V can ask Judy about making braindances, becoming atechie, and news from the Mox. Depending on the player's progress, Judy will also ask about what happened inJapantownduringPlay It Safe. If V expresses her frustration of not having more time to spend with Judy, she will reply "Quality over quantity, V. Just focus on tying up all your loose ends — then you and I are leaving this city once and for all". Moreover, Judy will occasionally send V affectionate text messages. This includes an enhanced photo from the braindance she is making based on their joint diving adventure to Laguna Bend (see gallery below) as well a message that she left a surprise in V's apartment, which turns out to be a fewChroManticore Carnivaldrinks and aCalavera Felizarranged in a heart-shape on the floor (see gallery below). Judy will also send a heads-up that her protective grandmotherAinarawill write to find out more about V as a partner for her "Ranita" ("little frog", an affectionate nickname). Giving the ideal answers (being polite, honest and serious about Judy) will prompt Ainara to respond that she likes and trusts V and offers to call her "abuela" ("grandma"). However, giving the worst possible answers or even blocking her will not affect V's and Judy's romance.
If V has romanced Judy and chooses to contact her to say goodbye at the end of the missionNocturne Op55N1, Johnny will admit that even he has grown to like her (despite the misgivings he voiced duringPyramid Song). Differentendingswith Judy as romantic partner are then possible, but only one allows you to maintain the relationship:
If V contacts Judy to say goodbye and asks Panam for help during Nocturne Op55N1 (maintain relationship):
If V contacts Judy to say goodbye and asks Rogue for help or decides to go in alone during Nocturne Op55N1 (breakup):
If V contacts Judy to say goodbye and accepts Hanako Arasaka's offer to help during Nocturne Op55N1 (breakup):
If V reaches Mikoshi but then gives their body to Johnny Silverhand (breakup):
If V leaves Songbird to Reed and gets rid of the Relic with the help of doctors of the FIA:

Panam Palmeris introduced as a former member of theAldecaldosnomadclan, who, after a family dispute, decided to live a more independent life as amercenary. She is also a possibleromanceoption forVwith a masculine body inCyberpunk 2077.
Panam Palmer was part of the Aldecaldos nomad tribe. Her best friend was captured by theRaffen Shiv, a hostile Nomad group, when they were a child, only to be saved by fellow-AldecaldoCassidy Righter- an incident that deeply affected Panam into her adulthood, to the point of never telling anyone what happened in order to forget about it. Cassidy would remain a close friend of Panam and become somewhat protective of her.[3]Panam also befriended several other clan members, includingMitch AndersonandDriss "Scorpion" Meriana. Panam idolizedSaul Bright, a fellow Aldecaldo who used to pull off impressive as well as funny stunts in his earlier years.[4]
At some time, Panam and Mitch were hauling cargo fromSan FranciscotoKansasfor the owner of asyn-meatfarm. The stench at the farm got Panam so sick that she puked on the owner's boots to which he simply replied "No need to bow, I'll just take a handshake."[5]Another "long story with many twists and turns" involved the corpse of the Deputy Finance Director ofKaukazriding in Panam's trunk.[6][7]
At some point, Panam's clan set up camp in theBadlandsoutsideNight City. She didn't see eye to eye with the clan's leader, Saul Bright, who was trying to strike a deal withBiotechnicain his attempt to keep the clan alive with consistent work. Panam disapproved, believing the clan should remain independent from corporations. Together with Scorpion, Panam kept joking about getting Mitch on board and heading off toOregonon their own.[8]Panam's conflict with Saul came to a head, however, when, due to her rebellious attitude, she eventually left the clan and moved to Night City, even though her friend Mitch tried to talk her out of it at first.[9]Working as a mercenary under the fixerRogue, Panam was often paired with nomadNashon a few gigs, though she was unaware he wasRaffen Shiv.[10]Despite moving away, Panam maintained communication with members of the Aldecados, including her close friends Mitch Anderson and Scorpion.
During an assignment to deliver "merchandise", Panam was betrayed by Nash, who stole both their cargo and herThorton Mackinaw "Warhorse".[11]Having messed up, she angrily confronted Rogue at theAfterlife, leaving without compensation or help to recover the stolen items. Some time later, Panam was contacted by local mercV, who had been directed to her by Rogue to help captureAnders Hellman. After V helps Panam recover her merchandise by ambushing the Raffen Shiv inRocky Ridge, and optionally also to get back her car by attacking and killing Nash in his hideout, she agreed to help them capture Hellman fromKang Taoforces, whoseAVwas predicted to pass across theBadlands.[10]
Planning to ground the airborne convoy, Panam and V stormed theSatwave Power PlantonJackson Plainsand modified the systems into anEMP. When it failed to stop them, she used a rocket launcher to ground the vehicle. However, Panam's friends Mitch and Scorpion underestimated the survivingKang Taoguards at the crashed convoy and rushed in alone, which got Scorpion killed and MItch taken hostage by a surviving guard. Scorpion's death left Panam devastated.
If V assists Panam in clearing the wreckage:
If V abandons Panam and heads straight for the gas station:
Some time later, Saul Bright disappeared with a small party of Aldecados. Learning of the attack, Panam returned to the Aldecados to help investigate. Eventually, they discovered the group had been ambushed byWraiths, a Raffen Shiv gang, and Saul had been captured. As the interim-leader of the clan,Carol Emeka, was hesitant to take action and was worried about the Aldecaldos camp's vulnerability, Panam took it upon herself to act and contacted V to ask for assistance. As V agrees to help, Panam remarks "Do you know how good it is to hear that?" and asks to meet at the Aldecaldos camp, where the two along with Mitch go over some drone intel on the Wraith camp Saul is being kept at. As the plan is covert infiltration, only V and Panam set out, with the latter remaining at distance to provide the former with sniper cover fire if needed.[4]
If V fails to rescue Saul:
If V successfully helps to rescue Saul:
If V has a masculine body (regardless of voice type and genitalia), they can pursue a romantic relationship with Panam. As such, Panam is unique as she is the only potential romantic partner for V, who can also be called for help duringNocturne Op55N1towards the end of the game.
V can begin to flirt with Panam in theSunset Motel barat the end ofGhost Town, suggesting that they only get one room together. Although it will upset her initially, not completing the optional objectives earlier to assist Panam against the Raffen Shiv and Nash makes no difference. Panam agrees to sharing a room as that would save them money, pointing out that there are twin beds in every room. If V pursues the matter further, Panam first plays naive and then makes clear that they can "celebrate"... but not today. In their joint room, Panam will just immediately go to sleep in full clothes.
V can resume flirting in the abandoned farmhouse at the end ofRiders on the Storm, after Saul went to bed. Although Panam will reject V touching her thigh, they can offer to fulfill her any wish, after which she replies "Careful, you can't know what I'd wish for..." and puts her legs on V's lap. Both fall asleep andJohnny Silverhandchimes in, wishing them sweet dreams. As Panam is about to depart the next morning, V has the option to ask her about last night, to which Panam replies that she is not that kind of girl. After V asks just what kind of girl she is, she responds by pulling him in for a kiss. Johnny then appears again, saying V should ride right after her if circumstances were different, but then and there they can just look. Johnny moves on saying "Damn hard to catch a girl like that. Only hope you've got is they feel a pang and stop to wait."
DuringWith a Little Help from My Friends, V finds some time with Panam alone in the control tower and can choose to tell her that he missed her pretty bad. Panam immediately gets uncomfortable, as she is not used to talking about feelings. If V presses the issue, Panam admits that she also wants to talk about "it", but moves on by saying "My plan was to tiptoe around, test the waters, then retreat back into my shell." She adds that her hesitance is motivated by a fear to cock things up due to her volatile behavior and that, with V, she does not want to act on impulses but prefers to play it safe because - this time - she really cares. Later at the campfire with the other nomads, V can scooch closer to Panam and put his arm around her while looking at the stars together.
Not initiating any of the advances described above has no effect on the following romance option with Panam.
If V has romanced Panam, he can choose to call her to say goodbye at the end of the missionNocturne Op55N1, which will unlock differentendingswith her. Before calling, V sighs that he only wants to hear Panam's voice but Johnny is wary that V might solicit the Aldecaldos' help against his advice and says "Sure as hell hope it's that and only that." During the call, a sleepy Panam offers her help and, sensing V's serious distress, tells him to call back after taking a few deep breaths and rethinking everything. She then reminds V that she is there for him and hangs up. Following this, only one choice allows you to maintain the relationship, while the others remain ambiguous as to its fate:
If V contacts Panam to say goodbye and then calls again asking her for help during Nocturne Op55N1 (maintain relationship):
If V contacts Panam to say goodbye and asks Rogue for help or decides to go in alone during Nocturne Op55N1 (ambiguous):
If V contacts Panam to say goodbye and accepts Hanako Arasaka's offer to help during Nocturne Op55N1 (ambiguous):
If V reaches Mikoshi but then gives his body to Johnny Silverhand:
If V accepts the NUSA's offer to cure them (Phantom Liberty):

Goro Takemura(Japanese: 竹村 五郎,Hepburn:Takemura Goro) is the former personal bodyguard ofSaburo Arasaka.[4]He is a stoic man of honor and fiercely loyal toArasaka, but finds himself betrayed and out of his element inNight City.
Goro Takemura was born in the slums ofChiba-11, the district with the highest murder rate in all ofJapan. It's unknown what became of his mother; as his father worked full-time in a kitchen, Goro's grandmother used to tell him stories about yōkai.
Arasakamilitary transporters would occasionally pass through Chiba-11, picking children from the district to conscript into their army. As a kid, he and other young boys would go to wash their shirts in a polluted canal, because of a rumor that only the cleanest children would get chosen. Arasaka eventually chose him, a moment that lifted him out of poverty, and that he compared with having won the lottery. In the army, his basic needs were provided for more consistently and appropriately than before, and he would go on to join Arasaka's special forces division. Once his efforts were recognized, he was offered attendance at the Arasaka academy - an actual education - and graduated at the top of his class.
At some pointSaburo Arasakacame to recruit a new personal bodyguard out of the one hundred soldiers the corporation deemed most skilled and loyal (a recruitment pool which may or may not be identical with the one for service at theArasaka Family Compound). His loyalty to the family was beyond question, and he idolized his CEO.
As Saburo's personal protector, Takemura received one-of-a-kind cyberware, including an endoskeleton.
Takemura personally trained the cyberninjaSandayu Oda, who served as the bodyguard ofHanako Arasaka.[4]
In 2077, Takemura accompanied Saburo Arasaka toKonpeki Plaza,Night City, where the CEO intended to confront his sonYorinobufor stealing theRelic. Takemura was about to commence a full sweep of the penthouse, but was ordered out of the room by Saburo only moments before he would have uncoveredVandJackie Welles. After he andAdam Smasherhad left, the hidden mercenaries were witness to a family argument, during the sad climax of which Yorinobu strangled his father in the heat of anger.
Immediately after the deed, the murderer alerted security, claiming that Saburo had been poisoned. He took advantage of Takemura's visible shock to assert his authority as the head of Arasaka family and corporation, ordering him to find the murderers before leaving the suite.
After V and Jackie had escaped Konpeki Plaza, Takemura tracked downDexter DeShawn, who had set up the heist. As Jackie Welles had succumbed to his injuries and DeShawn had shot V and dumped their body intothe landfillto cover his tracks, Takemura forced him to lead him to V. After he had dragged V out and attempted to bargain for his life, Takemura unceremoniously killed DeShawn with one single shot. Then Takemura called Yorinobu and told that the murderer had been found, and that he would deliver them in around an hour. Shortly after leaving the landfill, a group of assassins sent by Yorinobu approached them by motorcycle and attempted to kill Takemura and V. After beating the assassins, Takemura was injured, and V was in critical condition. Takemura told V to call someone who could save them, and V made every effort to callDelamainto deliver them toViktor Vektor, and then passed out.
After V recovered, Takemura contacted V to discuss how to take revenge against Yorinobu, calling him to account for his crime. Takemura revealed that he initially attempted to contactEvelyn Parker, who had an intimate relationship with Yorinobu Arasaka, but failed. Then V told Takemura thatAnders Hellmanshould be helpful, but Takemura said Hellman was just a pawn and had left Arasaka. He claimed the existence of powerful allies, who would be able to help clear their names and remove Yorinobu from power.[3]But anyway, Takemura still advised V to find Parker and Hellman first.
After V found Anders Hellman, who escaped from theKang TaoAV hit by EMP (and a rocket) and was stationed at a gas station, V called Takemura to come and ask Hellman some questions.
Later, Takemura tried to contact an old friend of his:Hanako Arasaka's bodyguard -Sandayu Oda. He arranged a personal meeting, giving V the opportunity to tell the truth about Saburo Arasaka's death. However, Oda refused to listen. While letting them go, he threatened that the next time he would not be as lenient. Whether by accident or on purpose, Oda let slip that Hanako was visiting Night City for the parade during Aratama-matsuri festival.[5]
Deeming that this was the only chance to reveal the truth to Hanako Arasaka, Takemura sought help from V for approaching Hanako during the parade. They askedWakako Okadathe information about the parade.[6]
Having formed the plan to jump on the dashi float from which Hanako Arasaka would be giving her speech, he invited V to help him test a virus he picked up in Kabuki on the parade ground's CCTV room, an attempt which was successful, and gave them full access to the cameras in the area. Afterwards, with or without V's help, he conducts a reconnaissance of theArasaka Industrial Park, where the floats were in the process of being assembled. Once again, V helped Takemura upload the virus from before into Hanako's float.[2]
During the parade, V took out the three snipers who would have prevented Takemura from getting on the float alive, only to hear that anetrunnerhad overridden the virus-granted access. While taking out the netrunner, V encountered Oda, who had been trying in vain to warnAdam Smasherabout security concerns the entire time. He told V that they and Takemura should've left the city, like he told them last time they met. V finally defeated him with the help of Takemura's advice, having been Oda's teacher. After asking his ally to spare the defeated foe, he entered the float and tried to explain himself to Hanako Arasaka. However, Hanako tried to flee instead of listening, so Takemura shot her with a sedative administered via a tranquillizer gun that V didn't know about. He tells V to run before they unplug themself from the network, alarmed at what had just happened.[7]
Having abducted the late CEO's daughter, Takemura took her to an abandoned apartment building he had been staying at, and called V to hurry over. After V came to the hideout, they tried to convince Hanako of what happened in Konpeki Plaza, telling Hanako about the Relic in the process. However, Hanako reactivated her tracker and Arasaka forces almost immediately stormed the building, shooting the wall down. V could see Takemura shielding Hanako from the gunfire with his own body, before they were hit by a stray EMP grenade. After they regained their vision, disoriented and staggered, V could see Hanako being carried away byAdam Smasher, who departed in the AV that had destroyed the wall. An Arasaka soldier ordered V to get on the ground, to which the floor collapsed under them both, and they fell.
When V regained consciousness after their fall, on top of a pile of rubble, Takemura yelling at them to run could be heard faintly from the third floor. The engram ofJohnny Silverhandtold them that Takemura was already dead and also advised them to run.[8]
If V left Takemura behind inSearch and Destroy:
If V went back for Takemura inSearch and Destroy:
After escaping the ambush Takemura urges V to split up, thinking they would both have a better chance of escaping Arasaka's notice on their own. Afterwards, he was contacted by Hanako, who had him brought to a secure location. In a text message to V after Hanako contacts them, he expresses gratitude for his life and concern for their wellbeing.[8]
In the motel V escapes to after the ambush, Hanako Arasaka contacts them via proxy and reveals that Takemura had, at some point prior, placed a tracker on V.
On the way, Hellman's comment about V's physical condition angered Takemura. He defended the mercenary so vehemently that Hanako interrupted the conversation to steer it back towards planning.[9]
CD Projekt REDwanted to tell a more corporate part of the main story, regardingArasaka. Initially, they had a female character namedAyumi Gozenas a villain, but wanted to instead show a more human side of the corporation.Philipp Weber, Acting Lead Quest Designer at CD Projekt RED, wanted to create a character who was very close toSaburo, sharing his traditional values and believing that Arasaka's actions is morally right. Takemura came to life as a character who — in their own mind — was able to justify that everything they did for Arasaka was for the greater good. He believes in honour and traditional Japanese values. However, as the developers were concerned that players would be unable to empathize, they began to humanize him, wanting to display a character who had been forced to make terrible choices to guarantee his survival. This is the reason behind his likeable personality traits, such as being a foodie, the way he's not very good dealing with technology etc.
Overall, Takemura is supposed to be a character who genuinely believes that what he is doing for Arasaka is the right thing to do.[12]

Adam Smasheris afull borgmercenaryemployed byArasakawho became a notorioussoloand rival ofMorgan Blackhand. By2077, he had risen to the position of head of security within Arasaka and the personal bodyguard ofYorinobu Arasaka.
Smasher is a towering cyborg, with little humanity left to be seen, not that he ever had much. After being reduced to mush by a rocket blast, Arasaka offered him a choice—either pull the plug or become a full body conversion cyborg. With little to no options and a lack of care for his human side, he agreed and became more machine than man. Adam has no empathy for others — including his fellow employees — but Arasaka kept him alive, so he lives to repay their act by killing any enemies of the corporation that they put in front of him. Adam can only be described in one way, pure uncontrolled evil.
Adam was born in June 21st[X 1]to a BronxAmericanfather and aRussianmother. Growing up in the streets ofNew York City, in the South Bronx, Adam considered himself the meanest and toughest kid on his block, eventually joining his neighborhood combatgang. Despite being a fairly typical worthless punk, during theCollapse, Adam became the gang's leader, often rumbling around what was left of the Yankee Stadium. When theUnited States Armed Forceswiped out the last one of his gangoons, Smasher enlisted right away. He spent six years in the Marine Corps, where he learned many different skills and became a 108kg strong man. However, he was discharged for insubordination.[1][2][3]
After returning to his hometown, Adam took up the life of amercenary, specializing in nasty and destructive gigs. Over the following years, he considered New York his stomping ground, accepting all kinds of dangerous jobs, from extractions or harassment to assassination and demolition. It was a good life for him, as his lack of squeamishness and sadistic thoroughness brought in enough jobs to keep him in guns, gear, drugs, and brutal one-night stands. Everything changed in2015when the local branch ofArasakaemployed him and other mercs to steal a prototype tech from a competitor. During the job, two rocket-propelled grenades maimed Adam, who was later transported to a medical center where he effectively died for over eight minutes before the doctors managed to reanimate his brain. What remained of Adam's body was brought in by his teammates inside a backpack. Around this time, Smasher realized he was getting all of his inputs through interface, with his sensorial organs being inside gel at some corporate installations. Arasaka, preemptively knowing what Adam's fate would be, had already prepared a deal for him; afull body conversionin return for a "15"-year employment contract. In Adam's own words: "They figured I'd just walked into some bad luck and they liked my resume, performance record, skill, good looks and all that." The young man knew only a bit aboutcyberware, and he never had the money to afford an FBC, so he never thought about it either. But while in the life support tank, Adam knew that if he refused the deal, the next day, his remains would be in someone's body bank. With no other choice, nor any thoughts of lost humanity bothering him anyway, he accepted the corp deal.[1][2][3]
Once inside his new chromed body, Adam Smasher realized that was the best decision he had ever made. After returning to the streets of NYC, with Arasaka allowing him time for freelancing, Adam used his new power to spill the blood of anyone that dared to cross his path, including boosterpunks, powered-armor soldiers, corporate hitmen, heavy-duty armed vehicles, dangerous cyberpets, or even children. For Smasher, metal was better than meat. He was obtaining so many gigs that there was no idle time for him, soon gaining fame along the eastern seaboard. He was hired out for almost any mission presented to him, as long as it wasn't an obvious suicide or double-cross. He did have one stipulation: collateral damage and civilian casualties were a must. Most of his time, however, was contracted by Arasaka, who put Smasher on offensive field duty, harassing the competition, and on some occasions in retrieval missions as well. One time he got shot point blank to the chest with a 40mm grenade launcher, throwing Adam off a building's rooftop and falling down nine stories onto a garbage truck. Right after, he returned to the roof to rip the enemy soldier's head off.
Over the following years, Adam defended the New York branch of Arasaka, killing dozens of merc crews that tried to infiltrate the building, while at the same time cleansing the city of what he considered a "fleshy infection." Once, a team of mercenaries were successful in stealing Arasaka files from the local offices, so Smasher pursued the last reaming member who tried to flee after going into a nearby mallplex. If he had been in his meat body, Adam would have needed a minigun to clear the way to pursue his objective. With his metal body, however, weapons as powerful as a minigun were a treat for him, as he could incorporate them into his frame, allowing Smasher to carry heavy weaponry with ease while feeling almost no recoil whatsoever. On the other hand, the meat merc that was escaping could only carry "small weapons," as anything bigger would turn their skeleton to kibble, in Smasher's opinion. Adam was able to catch up to her, though she hid amidst the mallplex crowd. Smasher swept over the multitude with hisTsunami Helixarm-gatling shotgun. In his view, he would never face any repercussions as he didn't wear any corporate tags, colors or logos when on an outside job, and even then, he always wore a differentfacemaskeach time he was deployed. Once the surviving crowd had dispersed, Smasher approached the countless bodies to retrieve the files from the corpse of the merc girl.[1][2]
Over the years, Smasher also developed a quiet rivalry withMorgan Blackhand, seeing the classicsoloas a threat to his metal-is-better-than-meat worldview. Adam had repeatedly tried to challenge him to a face-off, but Morgan only ignored him at every possible confrontation. Naturally, this snubbing had simply stoked the cyborg's psychopathic rage higher.[2]
By2020, Smasher liked to call himself a trueborg, with little real flesh remaining on his body. He thought that humanity was obsolete, and meat would eventually be replaced, including the mind. With this belief, Adam had the opportunity to write an article for theSolo of Fortunemagazine, where he endorsed the full body conversion, stating that anyone who didn't convert would get wiped out.
He had multiple custom FBC designs at his disposal, which were prepped before any operation so people couldn't tell who he was. Although he wished to spend his time mowing down civilians, Smasher knew that it was a dangerous endeavor, as he could still get killed if anyone with military-level hardware approached. For this reason he was expecting to get his hands on the newCybermatrix Reactive Body Plating, which was equipped with body sensors that would warn him of any laser-targeted weapons, allowing Adam to dodge any incoming bullets with his boosterware. Smasher also loved to show off his weaponry; one time a punk insisted that hisMalorian Arms 3516could put a hole on Smasher's frame, but the borg laughed it off, showing what a real gun was to him. Smasher dragged out aMagnum Opus Hellbringerand blew off the punk's head with it.[1]
In2022, Adam Smasher was fully employed by Arasaka to fight in theFourth Corporate War. He was more than happy to do this because he knew Blackhand had been hired byMilitech, Arasaka's rival in the war.[2]During the conflict, Smasher specialized — and took joy — in leading strike forces to slaughter communities full of not only Militech enemies but their families as well. One notorious attack took place inConnecticutduring September 17th 2022.[3]
On August 20th of2023, Smasher was present at theArasaka Towers. During the Militech assault, CEOKei Arasakaordered for Smasher and two squads to deal with the force that had infiltrated theSoulkillerlab at the 120th floor. An eager Adam and his team ambushed the Militech force led byJohnny Silverhand, pinning them down in a section of the laboratories. Silverhand tried to distract him in order to help the team escape, shouting and firing at the borg with hisMalorian Arms 3516, though this proved futile and got cut in half by Smasher in the process. This, however, gaveShaitanan opportunity to hold Smasher back while the rest of the team escaped.
Supplied him with everything he could ever want, Smasher later reappeared at the top of the towers equipped in anArasaka DaiOnipower armor that turned him into a nearly unstoppable machine. In his hand was Shaitan's biopod head, still alive. Adam waved at Morgan Blackhand, showing off Shaitan's head. This took the solo by surprise, who stepped down from one of the AVs to confront the borg. Adam provoked Blackhand by mentioning that Silverhand was dead, and Shaitan would soon be as well unless Morgan recovered the biopod from Smasher's hands. An angry Blackhand ordered his people to evacuate without him, and once the AV had lifted off, he turned to the borg with a remark about testing Smasher's "meat vs. metal" philosophy for itself shortly before the two launched themselves at each other in a last desperate attempt to kill the other. The outcome of the duel was never known, and soon after the building began to shake from the detonation of a nuclear device, causing theNight City Holocaust.[2][4]
Somehow, Adam survived the blast,[3]and he was supposedly tasked bySaburo Arasakato take care of Silverhand's body and his possessions, being one of the few people who knew where Johnny was buried.[5]Shortly after, Adam fell off the radar, disappearing for many years.[3]
During the next decades, there were multiple rumors of an unstoppable metal juggernaut which ran operations around the globe. How much of this was true remained a mystery however, nor it was ever confirmed if this individual (or individuals) was the real Smasher or someone claiming to be him.[3]Adam would reappear in Night City from time to time, where he also teamed up withRogue Amendiareson a few occasions.[6]
At some point after2045, Smasher seemingly found more of Silverhand's possessions inSamantha Stevens' garage and other parts of NC. Although he had sold much of the rockerboy's items, he decided to keep some of them — including Silverhand'sPorscheand his signature gun, theMalorian Arms 3516.[5]
At some point during the early-mid2070s, Adam was assigned asYorinobu Arasaka's bodyguard and was placed in charge of carrying out Arasaka's dirtiest work, gaining a reputation for expert management of loose ends.[7]During this time, he returned to Night City,[3]making theEbunike DocksinWatsonone of his bases of operations.Jeremiah Grayson, one of his most loyal men, became his right-hand, and for a job well done, Smasher gifted him Silverhand's 3516 pistol.[5]
In2076, Smasher was brought in by Arasaka counterintelligence agentsKateandDouglasto deal with the rampaging mercenaryDavid Martinez, who was in possession of an experimental Arasaka "cyberskeleton."[8]
When David arrived atArasaka Towerin Night City, Smasher emerged to save Douglas's life and engaged David. The two solos had a brief exchange of insults before David got distracted byFaraday— whom he had incapacitated moments ago — being taken away byTrauma Team. Smasher would take this opportunity to shoot David in the gut, resulting in him briefly goingcyberpsychoand activating hisSandevistan. Smasher responded by doing the same, and fired a missile that directly hit the back of David's exo-skeleton with enough force to eject the latter,Lucy, and Faraday (still strapped to Trauma Team's stretcher) out of Arasaka Tower, the latter of whom fell to his death.
David briefly managed to escape with Lucy, only for Smasher to follow, crushingRebeccato death in the process. Now in insideMemorial Park,Falcoattempted to slow Smasher down but was simply swatted away. David, on the verge of total cyberpsychosis, activated his Sandevistan again, but was shocked to see Smasher being able to keep up with him, with the latter scoffing that it was a "rudimentary implant." Lucy tried toquickhackSmasher, but this had little effect other than annoying him briefly before hercyberdeckfried. Smasher became briefly distracted trying to kill an escaping Lucy and Falco, which David used as an opportunity to immobilize the cyborg. An amused Smasher responded by ripping off the anti-grav devices from the exo-skeleton, causing it to crumble under its own weight, and proceeded to beat a now crippled David. After ripping the exo-skeleton apart completely, Smasher stood over a limbless David, commenting that he "had some fun, after all;" and mentioned David could have become "an interestingconstruct." David didn't care whatsoever about his words, then Smasher executed him with a shot to the skull at point-blank range.[8]
Later that same year, a high-ranking Arasaka executive tried to get his hands onDavid's Jacketbiomonitor. If themercenarycrew that was hired by a different party to obtain it didn't give him the item, the corpo employed Adam Smasher to retrieve it from their corpses.[9]
By 2077, Adam was still Yorinobu's bodyguard. He usually accompanied him to theKonpeki Plazapenthouse, even scaring guests such asEvelyn Parker.[10]A number of weeks after, while the mercsVandJackie Wellesconducted aheistfor theRelicin the penthouse, Smasher accompanied Yorinobu as his fatherSaburoarrived to talk with him. Smasher and Saburo's bodyguard,Goro Takemura, left shortly before Yorinobu snapped and strangled his father. Smasher attempted to stop the witnesses, V and Jackie, but they manage to escape before he could catch them.[11]
Upon Saburo's death, Yorinobu became CEO of Arasaka, promoting Smasher to Head of Security. During the memorial parade for Saburo,Sandayu Odawarned Smasher that the parade was to be sabotaged in an effort to harm Yorinobu's sister,Hanako. Smasher brushed off Oda's warnings, accusing Oda of disobeying Yorinobu as Oda persisted in questioning Smasher's actions. Oda was ultimately correct — with V's help, Takemura gained access to Hanako's float in order to kidnap her. Smasher afterwards led an Arasaka strike team, personally rescuing Hanako and ordered for her kidnappers to be killed.[12][13]

She was described as a beautiful and talented woman; having worked for theITSCorporation, and being the developer of the infamousSoulkillerprogram. Cunningham was also the girlfriend of the famousrockerboyJohnny Silverhand.
Her whole life changed however, when she was kidnapped by theArasakaCorporation, who used her to create a version of the program for them, and later made her the program's first victim. Now her consciousness exists only as a digital ghost inthe Net.
Cunningham was one of those rare few geniuses who could not only runthe Net, but also create new concepts and new code. She wasn't just your typicalnetrunner, but one of the best programmers in the world.
Like many others during her age, Cunningham spent money to upgrade her body, enhancing her beauty with the best European bodysculpting money could buy. She also bought the neural processors and interface plugs needed to navigate the Net, and a golden cyberarm with a hidden compartment, specially designed to hold aFederated Arms X-22pistol.
Shortly after the Pacifica region of the Net was formed, Cunningham would run the region withRache Bartmoss, later calling these times her best netrunning memories.[4]
Cunningham was famed for her skills at seeing software development on a different level. Due to her abilities, she was poached by the mysteriousITScorporation. During her employment, she began development on a revolutionary human/AI transfer program. Alt kept investing heavily in neural processingcyberwareto augment her netrunning skills.[3]
During this time she metJohnny Silverhandand the two entered into a relationship.
Fascinated by the development of artificial intelligence, Cunningham made a breakthrough in the transfer and containment of intelligence, both AI and the human mind. The unnamed program was able to transfer the user's mind into the Net and explore independent of their existing body. Her employer, ITS, capitalized on the breakthrough and developed it further into a weapon known as theSoulkiller. Instead of transferring personalities, it imprisoned them.
On April 15th, 2013, while leaving a concert with her boyfriend, she was kidnapped by gangers and Silverhand was left for dead. The kidnappers were hired byToshiro Harada, who wanted Cunningham to recreate the program for theArasakaCorporation. While captive, she rebuilt the software from memory and watched closely with the fear of Arasaka testing it on her. To prevent this, she built a fail-safe to ensure that she could make her escape.
Having survived his injuries, a team led by Johnny Silverhand started a riot atArasaka Tower, with his legion of fans. Fearing the worst, Harada used the software on Cunningham, but before he was successful she managed to fend off the attack, killing the Arasaka netrunner team and incapacitating Harada's bodyguard,Akira, from within the Arasaka mainframe. Silverhand detonated an explosive charge which gave Harada the chance to disconnect Cunningham from her body. Silverhand killed Harada and disconnected Cunningham from the Arasaka mainframe, killing her in the process. Silverhand left with her lifeless body, unknowingly leaving her digital form behind.[5]
Not long after, Cunningham's digital personality contacted Silverhand telling him she was in Arasaka Tower.  She also told him not to come after her.
In 2021,[6]during theFourth Corporate War, Alt Cunningham's digital ghost was contacted byMilitech, who asked for her help in destroying the Soukiller 2.0. She agreed with the hopes of taking revenge on Arasaka and convinced Rache Bartmoss to help in the effort.[7]She was later captured by Arasaka, who forced her to develop the Soulkiller 3.0.[8]
In 2023, Militech deployed an attack on theArasaka Towers, with Johnny Silverhand leading one of the teams with the hopes of rescuing Cunningham. After infiltrating the building, she was contacted bySpider Murphy, who informed her of Bartmoss' death before downloading her into the memory core. During the conversation, Cunningham gave Spider a piece of the Soulkiller to use if needed. Later, however, after the team got ambushed byAdam Smasherand two squads of Arasaka Troopers, Cunningham was scattered into the Net by Spider, with hopes of retrieving her someday.[9]
In the years following the Fourth Corporate War, Cunningham set up a digital haven for the other victims of Soulkiller. It was rumored to be hidden on a server somewhere in Night City or in the great white north of Canada, but after the bioplague wiped out the population, the "Ghost Town" was established in the ruins ofHong Kong.[3]
In 2077, Cunningham was still a very powerful entity on the Net. A memorial niche to Alt Cunningham can be found at theColumbariumin Night City.[10]Vencountered her after being forced to cross theBlackwallbyVoodoo Boys; while doing so, they relived Silverhand's memories of Cunningham before her physical death in 2013. The hope of the Voodoo Boys was that Cunningham would reveal herself to a familiar entity from her previous life.
Cunningham recognized the engram of Silverhand's and brought him and V to a safe place behindBlackwall. She revealed that she is nothing but an image of Alt Cunningham and is not actually her. The rogue AI explained that the engram was transferred to the Net during the 2013 raid. However, due to Silverhand disconnecting the physical embodiment of Alt Cunningham while she was still in the Net, her consciousness was split from the engram leaving her mind stuck in the Net while her body and consciousness laid dying in Silverhand's hands.
The engram kept the image of Alt Cunningham to keep itself from going insane as any other AI would in the Net over a prolonged time, asMikoshididn't exist back then to protect engrams from interference.
After Silverhand revealed the nature of V's goals, Cunningham did not see the situation as her problem. The two offered to take her to Mikoshi, which was the tech she would need. The AI explained that if they destroyed Mikoshi, she could try to create an engram of V if they were subjected to a Soulkiller program and then would transfer it back to their body. Doing so would kill V but allow the engram to be transferred back to their body allowing their brain to overwrite Silverhand's engram.

Rogue was a rebellious teen, knew stiff hierarchy of gang life was not for her and set out on her own, to become asolo. She was a new and successfulmercenaryinNight City. Rogue also began a relationship with hitrockerboysensationJohnny Silverhand. Rogue on occasion asked Johnny if they could visit adrive-in theatreon a date, which went largely ignored.
Her relationship with Johnny ended at some point in2011,[7]after Rogue found out about Johnny cheating on her.[8]
In2013, Rogue and her partner,Nomad Santiagowere mercs, being reputed to be the best at the time. During a meeting between the two of them in theAtlantis Club, Johnny Silverhand interrupted them by entering the room to ask for their help in raidingArasakato save his girlfriendAlt Cunningham. While Rogue was still held a sour spot for Johnny, she ended up agreeing along with Santiago for nothing more than to give it to thecorporations. The two participated in Silverhand's raid onArasaka Towerto recover Alt and theSoulkillerprogram alongside amediaknown asThompson, but the raid ended in failure as Alt was separated from her body, trapped in the Arasaka mainframe.[7]
At some point after 2013, Rogue had a brief romantic relationship withMorgan Blackhand, though it was not known by many.[9]
During theFourth Corporate War, Rogue participated in another Arasaka raid that would end up with theNight City Holocaust. She, alongsideSpider Murphy,Lyle Thompson,Shaitan, Johnny Silverhand, Morgan Blackhand, among others, raided theArasaka Towers. Johnny's team was attacked byAdam Smasherand a group of Arasaka troopers. Thompson was injured and Johnny was killed. After getting a chance to escape, Spider tried to reach Silverhand's body, but Rogue stopped her, telling the netrunner he was gone. Spider helped Rogue and the surviving soldiers to drag the wounded Thompson into the elevator. Afterwards they escaped by using anAVon the Towers' rooftop. Soon after anuclear device went off.[10]
At some point prior to2045Rogue got so badly injured in a car crash that evencyberwarecould not fix all of the internal damage. As such, she largely retired from the Solo lifestyle and became aFixer; holding court with local solos and acting as a middleman with potential contacts, providing them with valuable information and the intelligence they needed. Rogue also started operating theAfterlifein downtown Night City,[11][12]though she would later have torelocate the barinWatson.
By2077, Rogue's reputation as a solo continued to inspire and influence others. As the "Queen of the Afterlife", she was regarded as Night City's topfixer. She continued to manage the Afterlife surrounding herself with experts in their fields to follow through with her plans;Nixwas hired as the Afterlife's topnetrunner,Crispin Weylandwas her pick as the topsoloand bodyguard to accompany during big gigs,Emmerick Bronsonwas hired as the bouncer of the club, and finallyClaire Russellbecame the bartender who kept track of the customers. During this time she was contacted by a corporate bodyguard namedGoro Takemura, who had been searching for information on an ex-Arasakaemployee,Anders Hellman. Rogue recognized Takemura as the man accused of the murder ofSaburo Arasakaand because of this she turned him away before any trouble could be traced to the Afterlife.[3]
At some point, Rogue met with a lonenomad,Panam Palmer, who left her clan to work in Night City. She paired Panam with another nomad namedNashon a few gigs, but during an assignment to deliver "merchandise", Panam was betrayed by Nash, who stole both their cargo for theRaffen Shiv, and Panam's customizedThorton Mackinaw "Warhorse". Having messed up, Panam angrily confronted Rogue, however due to her mistake she refused to give compensation or help to recover the stolen items. After some time she was contacted by a local mercenary,V, who had been searching for information on Anders Hellman similar to Takemura before. Despite recognizing V as the sole survivor of the failed heist atKonpeki Plaza, which marked them as a merc with a body count behind them, she offered to give them the information they needed if they paid€$15,000. After receiving the payment she debriefed V with the information of aKang TaoAV that was transporting a VIP to secure location, V voiced concerns of working in theBadlandsand was paired with Panam, whom Rogue believed could help them retrieve what they needed. After giving V Panam's contact information, she went back to dealing with her business.
After successfully retrieving the stolen cargo from Nash, Panam called Rogue to gloat of her success. However, Rogue was not impressed and mocked Panam for having a high-temper and that fixing her own mistake was not an achievement, which only caused Panam to become angrier, disconnecting the call.[3]

He went in with a vision of changing the world through music, one he shared with his best friend,Johnny Silverhand, but their perspectives regarding the execution of this plan often came to conflict. This lead to Kerry's multiple attempts at leaving the band, which were nearly successful at launching his own solo career, but, eventually, the complex relationship he had with his friend always pulled him back.
In the end, Samurai's final disbandment followed Johnny's departure instead, which lead Kerry into a rocky couple of years. He ended up going back to his roots, staying on Masbate in theNew Philippinesfor two years, refilling his batteries and dealing with spiritual needs. Luckily, he did manage to recollect the pieces and came back to the music scene renewed and inspired, if not even encouraged by the idea of elevating his own name out of the shadow Silverhand left behind. This new beginning was rough but, just as all diamonds, through a lot of hard work and effort, his music managed to shine brighter even than contemporary commercial competitors. He withstood the test of time, his albums have gone platinum, his broken guitars had been auctioned for thousands ofEurodollarsand his singing voice is recognized worldwide.[4]
In2012, both Johnny and Kerry bought theGrand Illusionclub in Night City. As they didn't make the purchase public, it wasn't known by many. At some point later, driven by memories and using their influence, both rockers begun an open mike night on Thursdays which was regularly attended by anexecutiveofUniversal Records, the label under which both men recorded.[5]
Midway through the century, Kerry's life had taken an, most would say, unexpected turn, leaving him married toLouise Nordin Eurodynewith two children, Ted and Kim. The marriage ended on a low note, resulting in Louise getting most of their shared possessions, a house inTokyo, cars and children. Despite trying to stay in positive relations, Kerry's attempts at keeping in touch usually end up being misguided, and Louise has no trouble using it as a manner of preventing their children from idolising him. Life without a family, however, if one is to trust the words he chooses addressing the matter, seems to have benefited him, allowing a bit more freedom for thatrockerboylifestyle he managed to make a brand off. Whether that freedom was used in a creatively practical manner is a matter of debate.[6]
In 2077, Kerry can be found spending most days inhis own VillainNorth Oak, maintaining a successful career of a solo artist. His label,MSM MediaCorp, had already announced a new album in the works and the audience that is more accustomed to mass-produced reduplications has started growing impatient. As someone who gives great importance to public image, Kerry is deeply influenced by peer reviews - various articles mentioning him, his life and his business rivals can be found in all corners of his home. Staying concurrent and able to produce music that will agree with the times while simultaneously not conforming and retaining originality is not easy for any artist, especially one that has been in the public eye for half a century. While topics he addresses with his music, mainly the suffering of the people under the heavy foot ofcorporatecapitalism, has never truly gone stale and could provide yet another expected source of profit and affirmation, the sincerity of the thoughts put into the songs has started waning. Without inspiration, without a change to look forward to and without any real friends to speak of, Kerry slowly started falling back to a state he once was in, the overshadowing 2020s. The feeling of loss was mirrored in his social deprivation, reduction of individuality, depletion of creative inspiration and overall exhaustion of will, which lead his mind back to the source of negativity – the loss of a friend. A friend who cast a shadow so long that, even in his brightest moments, Kerry could still feel dousing his flame, regardless of decades passed and media scorn grinding the name down to not more than a footnote in the city's history.
For a peace of mind, every couple of years, Kerry would visit his guru Khian in Tangalan, go off the grid, recollect his thoughts and fulfil his spiritual needs, however, the tight schedule, public pressure and criticisms of the media put him in a rather difficult spot, forcing him to pick between the audience and his own health. Facing a familiar darkness, in a battle with his own conscience and desperate wish to keep himself afloat, he tries willing his recent acquaintance, Ariel Velasco, to stay with him, keep him company, no matter the excuse. Not feeling strong enough to admit the real reason behind this constant pestering, he tries offering Ariel a proper housekeeping job of any variety, resulting in a straightforward refusal of the offer.
Notably yet, the recent hot topic ofNight Cityscream sheets has been the rumor of Kerry attempting to end his own life, fortunately, prevented by a bodyguard who managed to take his gun away in time. The details of the event remain unclear although the constant mentions through media regurgitation managed to attract the attention of the digitized psyche of his long-since-departed friend, Johnny Silverhand. Not long after, a familiar sound of guitar interrupted Kerry's shower at home. Expecting an intruder able to bypass the high-end security, he faced them with a loaded gun. The way the guitar strings were plucked however, cast away all doubt that, in spite of appearances, within the head of a minor Afterlife merc before him, was his friend, the person on whose loss towers have been built. Kerry maintained a civil conduct, put up a brave front and denied all of the media accusations with a smile on his face, although a sliver of melancholy shone through every word he uttered, no matter how well he played the role. Now that Johnny is back, he thought there is maybe a chance for closure – one more Samurai gig, for old times' sake – In hopes of shedding the weight of the shadow once and for all. Kerry felt the need to prove to himself that it was not the loss that made him into what he is now, as he would still perform just as well with Johnny on stage beside him. In addition to this, he also desired to demonstrate to Johnny how he has made it fine without him. They agreed to get the band back together without dragging them into the complexity of Johnny's situation, so instead, the concert had been announced in honour of his name. To achieve this, they have set themselves on a path of finding Nancy, the keyboardist,Henry, the bassist and contactingDenny, the drummer, who has been living just a street away from Kerry. WhileVtakes care ofNancy, Kerry's duty is to get in touch with the band's divisive bassist Henry. There was no problem finding him, being situated in a rehabilitation facility, but his days there have not yet come to an end, so a permission to vacate the premises was not available.
This did not pose much of a drawback for Kerry, Henry willing, so they exited the building through a window. Their misadventure did not stop there – finding out his former partner, the drummer Denny, was living in the same city as him, everyone but him knowing, set Henry off the rails quickly. Being provided drugs right after detox did not help either, resulting in a series of rash decisions and irreversible events, which placed Kerry in the role of the problem's architect - being blamed by all parties. Denny will refuse spending another minute in Henry's presence, so a decision between the two must be made. A decision Kerry, as the initiator of the event and friend of both parties, cannot make on his own so V helped by giving the final verdict. Once the band members have been more or less collected, Kerry will find a replacement bassist or drummer for the gig.Drausinfrom the popular band Cutthroat will all but volunteer, as a big fan of Samurai, and will be capable of taking either spot. His enthusiasm for receiving something he always wished for affects Kerry the wrong way, so he tries to calm him down, downscaling the event's relevance and bringing up that he is the only one among them that achieved true fame. Whether this behaviour came from being nervous over still having something to prove to Johnny and the subject being taken lightly or due to knowing just how empty it feels to have your dreams come true, is left unanswered, but Kerry remained audibly annoyed, silently acknowledging being nervous to the point of shaking. The gig itself has been successful, executed rather professionally, with Kerry even taking a few moments to step into the spotlight in front of Johnny, which is something he would never have been able to achieve in the past. He admitted to Johnny later that, looking back at his expectations, he was not sure what he was so anxious about. One gig was quite enough to prove his own fears irrational. Although once V took over the body and the sore reality of Johnny truly being gone making itself apparent once more, Kerry quickly made himself scarce, leaving the feeling of having more pressing matters to attend to. V received a parting gift – Kerry's pistol, theArchangel, a novelty that comes with a story of being used to almost shoot Johnny with. Implied, although not spelled out, he no longer felt the need for it, now that he seems to be awake from a 50-year-old dream.
Returning to the present, Kerry is yet to face a different type of demon – finding out that a lazr pop sensation, girl group fromJapancalledUs Cracks, announced theirNUSAtour with a cover of his song – profit off his hard work without even notifying him of it, let alone consulting him regarding author's rights. Feeling attacked by the competition and fearing falling under someone's shadow again, Kerry hires the most effective merc he knew, that being V, to assist him in exacting revenge, Night City style. The most effective, yet least harmful way he could think of was simply preventing their gig from ever happening, so sabotaging the band's equipment seemed like the easiest way of achieving it. The mission had been planned out to the detail, from getting military-grade equipment from fans to making sure his identity remains unknown. V's only role in the ordeal was simply being backup, so Kerry managed to do the whole job on his own, even having fun while at it. The following car chase, once theNCPDcaught wind of the roadside explosion he caused, reminded him of better times in the past, of rare positive memories of Johnny – and he is very willing to compare them to current events. Losing the cops tailing them, per Kerry's request, the two have shared a coffee in Carnita Street's Chombatta fast food joint. While he does not say it aloud, excusing the visit by praising the coffee, the restaurant is yet another memento from a simpler time and days spent with Johnny. A little story explaining their youthful desperation and eating junk food followed. He once more falls back to reminiscing – being as upset about his song being covered without his consent might actually be due to, as Johnny once claimed, his striving for money and fame rather than love of music itself and artistic values. Having a media corporation leash around his neck and allowing them to make administrative decisions for him does not disprove Johnny's point. Kerry's state of mind then fell into V's hands, and, depending on their reaction to his opening up about feeling like nothing more than a product will heavily influence his following days.
Regardless of efforts invested into sabotaging the gig Us Cracks have scheduled, Kerry was informed that they would proceed with the event and simply obtain a different set of equipment for the performance. This was one step too far for Kerry's standards, so he decided to deal with the problem in person. Once more, he hired backup, and with V's help, infiltrated theLittle ChinaclubRiotin which Us Cracks were about to perform, barged into their dressing room and with a gun aimed at them demanded they call the concert off. V has the opportunity to alter Kerry's life once more, bringing up that both parties had managers work behind their backs and spread misinformation. If this is done, Kerry will own up to his harsh approach and apologize, opening up a path for future collaborations and a modernization of his own music, as well as the approach to a broader new-age audience. Should V instead follow the plan and support Kerry's threat, not allowing excusing arguments, the concert is called off and the two leave with a deep feeling of vindication. Kerry appears to be satisfied no matter the result and calls V some time later to an exclusive club inJapantown,Dark Matter, for a conclusion of their business. Depending on the choice made during the previous meeting, the club will have two different stories to tell.
In the case of reconciling Kerry with Us Cracks, V will walk in on a crazed crowd lined withjournalistsafter a collaborative concert with Us Cracks, where Kerry had just presented their new project, "Off the Leash" - a cover of his own song by the same title. He affirmed a positive position in the media, loudly denying any mention of potentially falling on hard times, while the girls from Us Cracks seem absolutely bedazzled by his presence. Kerry is not keen on upholding this act however, and as soon as he saw V, he will use them as an escape plan, leading them to the club balcony, explaining how he feels the need to get revenge on his managerL. B. Kovachekfor working behind his back.
The club will host an entirely different mood should V not unite Kerry with the girls. Dark Matter is silent, emptied out for the evening, Kerry sitting in a booth with his old friendSpector Cheng, looking rather distraught. Despite blaming managers, claiming ignorance and promising not to go on with covering the song, Us Cracks do regardless, sending Kerry a restraining order on top. Unable to deal with the situation directly, while leading V to the club's balcony, Kerry lays down a plan to hit Kovachek instead. The feeling of betrayal, learning his manager put the label before him and manipulating him to sign papers he otherwise would not, truly hit him hard, so he was not intending to let it go without a fight, especially since there was no way for him to actually fire the man, seeing how the media corporation he works for owns the rights to his songs.
Kerry is very aware of being in the corps' pocket but he simply dismisses the idea of breaking the contract as the price of fame – should he actually decide to leave, he would not be able to release his own music, deal with administration, promotion, the media and the fans all on his own. Considering the labels have their claws on all of it, he went into comparing that sort of life, something Samurai was known for, to yet another type of cage. Once they're out on the balcony bar, shut down for the remains of the day for Kerry's use alone, he melancholically praises the view, pointing out how it's an excellent place to look down on the city from, but the sadness in his voice and forlorn gaze into the distance shows that something seems to be terribly wrong. Whether V decides to ask about it or not, Kerry expresses himself in carefully chosen words. He has come to the realization that his dread brought on by the copyright infringement issue wasn't simply due to fear of public seeing him as a sell-out, but much deeper. He confesses realizing that the root of the fear was in fact falling under yet another shadow, barely days after he managed to release himself from the shackles Johnny's legacy restrained him with. He was not ready to get back to simply being part of the scenery that helps someone else shine brighter, especially since even now, that he is on the very top, he still wakes up daily thinking how it's only a matter of chance that he has not yet faded into the city's steam.
Kerry's life may be altered by V's chosen response to this revelation.
Declaring that he does not need anyone's help to keep himself afloat shows V believes in his strength and will invite an expression of hopefulness, albeit in a rather disconsolate, unconvincing tone.
A different approach offered is the romantic kind, where V may conclude the declaration of faith with a kiss. The gesture will be unexpected but only reciprocated in the case of male V, after which Kerry suffers a flash of uncertainty, asking whether Johnny was present during such an intimate exchange. The notion is rejected near immediately, as he reminded himself that he managed to grow out of Johnny's shade, so his presence no longer mattered. Looking back at the city spreading below his feet, he remembered the passing of time and expressed a wish to remain in this uniquely peaceful moment forever. However, life will not wait, so they departed - Kerry remaining a little bit longer on the balcony to process his thoughts and enjoy a rare breath of optimism about the coming days.
Within the next few days, Kerry contacted V once more, for what appeared to be a pleasant afternoon sailing. He brought a specialguitarwith him too, a custom-builtLancaster, one of five in the series. An instrument of high significance, on which he played a brand new tune, announcing, exclusively to V, that he has made a decision to close a chapter of his life. He elaborated that the first real and meaningful music he ever wrote was while out on the open sea, catering to the upper class on a cruise ship. Being here, on a yacht, after the success he achieved, he is finally coming to peace with the realization that Johnny's heritage was not in fact the basis of his own success. The two drove inspiration from different wells and, ultimately, their perception of beauty in this world differed - where one saw an opportunity to elevate, the other used it to incite rebellion. Closing the door on the days spent looking back, Kerry is finally ready to move away from practicing what he saw as Johnny's principles and start focusing on himself, building his own life instead, no longer afraid of his own shadow. He promised that the days of chaos and mayhem he would usually resort to were over – starting morning after, that is, as the assumed evening had an ulterior motive. Violently breaking the Lancaster, as would the ancient rocker tradition of concluding concerts demand, he mentioned that the luxurious yacht they were on was actually owned by L. B. Kovachek, the man he swore revenge on. Destroying it felt as if it would provide just the right amount of relief, considering the nature of the betrayal. V is invited to participate in this exhibition of savagery and potentially expand on their previous romantic exchange, right before an explosive finish, observed from the beach. Should V go along the romance route, Kerry will express interest in an encore. V's reply in this moment is of great significance once more. Stating that it was a one-time thing after all that's been said will push Kerry into a relapse, where he will close up and walk away without turning back, potentially undoing all personal growth he achieved over the past several days. On the other hand, agreeing with his proposal will start a relationship, after which, Kerry will drive V back toWatsonand head off home to focus on finishing off the new album. As he explained it, it will be titled after his own name, signifying a rebirth through songs that are nothing less than portraits of his old selves.[6]
In2079, advertisements showcase that Kerry will be doing a world tour that includes the cities ofWarsaw,Night City,Vancouver,Montreal,Tokyo,Seoul,FrankfurtandPraguebetween late July and August. WhenVcalls him, Kerry is currently playing in theCrystal Palace.[7]
The non-canonCyberGenerationsourcebookMediaFrontstates the reasoning of some of Kerry's early albums: "Modern Trenches" was about chronicling the tragedies of the heroes of theSecond Central American War; "Critical Mass" was a tribute to the victims of the 2008 destruction ofColorado Springs; and "Made in America" was a dedication to the families of theChicagobio-plague of 2012.[10]
Within Kerry's home are two linked terminals containing three files, songs in progress, enriched by the author's comments. All three songs appear prior to meeting him.[3]
Rarely, among the terminals within the Night City, most notably in Westbrook district, can an access to MSM's officialnetsitefor Kerry be found:netdir://msm.eurodyne.corp. Headed by an image of an early-concept rendition of the rockerboy, it may indicate the appearance of his cyberware at a previous moment of his career. The netsite is as straightforward as can be, consisting of a brief biographical entry, discography, tour information and a page containing interviews and officially-accepted statements intended to sate the fans' curiousity, while not letting the reader forget how MSM is responsible for both the success of the music and providing of content everyone enjoys. The reviews and several promotional lines can also be seen in the Complete Official Guide - Collector's Edition.
Though cutting-edge plastic surgery and rejuvenation treatments have regenerated pretty much every cell a thousand times over in the intervening decades, Kerry still bears a scar from his days playing bass for Samurai, earned when Johnny swung his mic stand straight into Kerry's lip during a particularly raucous abandoned-cellar gig. He's been through a lot since then-a record label deal with the corporate devil, stints on and off the wagon, a trip back to his roots in the Philippines and, most recently, a successful solo career-but he remains defined by the could-have-beens and shouldn't-have-beens of his time at Johnny's side.
His left arm sports a full-sleeve tattoo, a celebration of his Filipino heritage and love of music... but it's also an eerie echo of Johnny's silver arm. He's had vocal cord implants done to let him croon solo, but something in that perfect pitch sounds tuned for Johnny. Only when he meets V does Kerry get a chance to escape the unfinished hangover from his past and re-enter his own life.
The collector's edition guide book offers a screamsheet-style article detailing Eurodyne's career from a media perspective, focusing on his career, labels and direction of music. It is followed by positive critic reviews and decorated by poster illustrations and album covers.
Kerry Eurodyne - Rockerboy. Star. Charismatic guitarist and vocalist. A legend. Kerry Eurodyne is this era's undisputed king of REAL rock. Adored by his fans, praised by his critics, respected by his rivals. For years he's been riding a wave of popularity, resulting in instantly sold-out concerts and record-breaking plays of his songs.
His Career started in the underground punk band Samurai, until, he says, "One day I just decided to grow up," beginning his journey to true fame. Kerry went solo. The rest is history, filled with explosive sounds, unforgettable lyrics, Richter-scale-breaking stadium concerts, and countless hits.
Kerry Eurodyne's career soared under the wings of MSM. From the moment he signed, thus began the Golden Age of Kerry Eurodyne - month after month of topping the charts with hit singles like "Holdin' On" or "Scream and Whisper," perfectly choreographed, spectacular concert tours (how could anyone forget the "chrome" zeppelins in Memphis?!) and unprecedented artistic heights reached. The rockerboy lives in his beloved Night City and is currently working on his latest album, brought to you soon by MSM.
From his debut album, "False Terrorist" to the mystical "Aether", the hit "Spiral Distortion" and the surprisingly conceptual "Persuasion of the Undecided," all the way to the controversial "Second Conflict" - Kerry Eurodyne's music is a masterpiece of rock, with uncompromising lyrics, sounds and ideas that bring everyone together, no matter their ideological or spiritual creed - a one-size-fits-all.
The reviews included with the article are unequivocally positive, offering praise from angles of first-time listeners, seasoned fans and psychological content analysts, describing the impact of Eurodyne's music on the contemporary audience and its continuous increase in quality. Whether this assortment of glowing commentary is sincere or under the influence of media corporations is up to the reader to decide.

He is also a possibleromanceoption forVinCyberpunk 2077.
Growing up, River and his sisterJoss' parents ran a small farm. Eventually it went out of business as larger corporations took over the agriculture industry. His parents took to running a grocery store and the family of four lived in the apartment area above it.[5][6]
One day, some drugged up thugs broke in looking for cash and, when they didn't find any in the store, went into the living quarters and demanded money from the father, who swore they had nothing else. Not satisfied with that response, one of the thugs killed River and Joss' father and then put a gun in River's hand and had him point it at his own mother's head, demanding he shoot and kill her. River stalled, terrified, to the point the thug gave up trying to bait the child and took the gun and killed their mom himself before the thugs ran off, leaving River and Joss alive but now parentless. The siblings were then sent off to an orphanage to be cared for but the NCPD never caught the thugs who killed their parents. With this lack of justice, River saw this as complete incompetency regarding the NCPD and made it his goal to become a detective to solve cases like what happened to his family.[5]
Sometime prior to 2077, River had become an NCPD detective and was first partnered with Jamie Sheen, but Jamie later committed suicide over his frustration with how the top brass cared more about bribes rather than upholding the law. River continued serving as a detective though and sometime later was partnered with another detective,Harold Han, and even worked with well-established people likeJefferson Peralez.[7]
Meanwhile his sister, Joss, had married anAldecaldowith whom she had three children with:Randy,Dorian, andMonique. With his brother-in-law not being much of a father figure, River would step in and help take care of the children, particularly when he once caught his brother-in-law with one of his young sons, Dorian, at a dive bar in the middle of the night, so the detective took his nephew home much to his brother-in-law's ire. When Joss' husband later died, River continued to try and help support her and her children by buying them a new trailer to live in, which resulted in Randy taking over the old one as his own place. However, River and Joss eventually had a falling out sometime before 2077 over River's driven desire to bring justice for his victims' cases to the point it was all he could talk and think about, with little regard for his own family issues.[8][5]
At one point in 2077, he got a solid tip that MayorLucius Rhyne's life was in danger and had set out to speak with the mayor's security when a cyberpscyho,Péter Horváth, attacked right after River got there. River managed to incapacitate the would-be attacker before they could find and kill the mayor and the deputy mayor,Weldon Holt. River was subsequently celebrated by the press as "super cop" and received the Medal of Merit.[9]However, Rhyne ended up dying anyways later that day from a separate heart problem. This odd coincidence didn't go unnoticed to River, but he had no way to really link the two incidents, especially as his superior ordered him to drop the case and even his partner, Harold, warned him to not re-open it.[7]
If V completesI Fought the Law:
If V has a feminine body (regardless of voice type and genitalia), they can pursue a romantic relationship with River. With only three missions, none of which are part of the main story, River is the romantic option with the shortest storyline.
No romantic advances are made by either side duringI Fought the LaworThe Hunt. The first indication of affection is actually given byJossin the kitchen duringFollowing the River, when she mentions to V that River "can't seem to stop gushing about you". Later during dinner, Joss repeats her observation, noting that her brother likes V, slightly embarrassing a shy River. V can ask whether River actually put his sister up to saying that, which she admits to be true. River's nephews, Dorian and Monique, then make the situation even more awkward as they both raise hands asking "Who thinks V and Uncle River make a good couple?". V can choose to also raise her hand after which River gets up from the table, saying that he pulls V out of this "ambush". If V does not raise her hand, River will simply remark "Now that that's decided...". In any case, River then takes V on top of the adjacent water tower, a great spot for the views, as River puts it. After gifting V his gun,Crash, River asks whether she knows why they are there together, adding "Say you do. Please don't string me along." V can choose to tell River about previous, horrible pickup lines guys tried on her. Eventually, he asks whether he stands a chance, to which V can either react positively, but adding that he better not fall in love with her (to which he responds "Too late."), or negatively, adding that they can stay friends. In the former case, V will then get the option to kiss River or a last chance to back down and abort the flirt. Friend-zoning River or aborting the flirt at the last minute will result in the evening playing out as if V was male without romance (seeBiography). Kissing River, on the other hand, will initiate a cut-scene of both passionately kissing, making their way back to the house, sneaking by the sleeping kids, and having sex in River's room while staying as quiet as possible.
The next morning, Johnny appears and comments "Christ, V. Can't believe you're making me fuck a cop. Gonna go plug my ears, gouge my eyes.". Over some coffee, River asks whether their relationship is going anywhere longer term. V can choose to tell River about therelicand her impending death. Eventually, V can choose to kiss River and accept a relationship (to which both comment with "Let's give it a try.") or reject him, either claiming that it was just a one-night-stand (to which River reacts calmly but disappointed) or that V's condition simply keeps her from making such a commitment (to which River reacts understanding). Joss then comes in and cuts their conversation short, reminding River to get the power generator fixed so everything is ready for when Randy gets out of the hospital.
After this, River can be found at theKutcher's home. If V agreed to a relationship with River, she can ask him if he is upset that V is busy (to which he responds "We'll make up for it.") or tell him that things are not working out between the two. The latter option will prompt V to quickly move on by saying "[...] Rambling. Just forget I said anything." to which River replies "Already forgotten.". River will also send a couple of romantic text messages to V, one ending with "I've got a good feeling about this, And well.. I'm just happy, like, dumb happy, you know? You're really amazing, V".
If V has romanced River and chooses to contact him to say goodbye at the end of the missionNocturne Op55N1, she will refer to him as "that one stubborn badge" toward Johnny, to which he only replies: "Mhm". Differentendingswith River as romantic partner are then possible, but not all allow you to maintain the relationship:
If V contacts River to say goodbye and asks Rogue for help or decides to go in alone during Nocturne Op55N1 (maintain relationship):
If V contacts River to say goodbye and accepts Hanako Arasaka's offer to help during Nocturne Op55N1 (maintain relationship):
If V contacts River to say goodbye and asks Panam for help during Nocturne Op55N1 (breakup):
If V reaches Mikoshi but then gives his body to Johnny Silverhand:
If V accepts the NUSA's offer to cure them (Phantom Liberty):

Evelyn Parkerwas adollliving inNight City.
Evelyn Parker's intelligence and ambition drives her to demand more from life. Her goal of becoming a professional actress, and her rational head for the biz, led her to a job at the doll houseClouds, but this stepping stone in her career quickly became something much more permanent.[1][2]It was in her days at Clouds where she met and befriendedJudy Álvarez.[3]
In 2077, Evelyn was a consort and frequent guest ofYorinobu ArasakaatKonpeki Plaza. TheVoodoo Boyslearned of this and hired her to acquire abraindancerecording of Yorinobu's suite for a planned heist. Evelyn realized that the Voodoo Boys were after a biochip known as theRelicwhich containedJohnny Silverhand's engram and was in Yorinobu's possession. She decided to steal it for her own profit and contactedNetWatch, offering to give the Relic to them in exchange for money, protection, and a new identity.[4][5]
Evelyn contracted the fixerDexter DeShawnto plan and execute the heist of Konpeki Plaza. As a part of the team DeShawn picked,Vwas introduced to her, playing an important role in researching the material from a BD (with the help of her friend Judy), evaluating the dangers and negotiating the terms of the business contract. Due to DeShawn's fixer history, Evelyn trusted V with an alternative offer - eliminating him entirely from the heist equation and gaining a bigger slice of the resulting profit.[6]
When the heist went south, with DeShawn being killed by Arasaka and V on the run with the Relic chip being fused to their brain, Evelyn lay low for several days atLizzie's Barunder the protection of theMoxes, but eventually decided to return to work at Clouds. There, while she was with a client and connected to the Net, the Voodoo Boys launched a powerful virus on her to try and silence Evelyn since she not only worked behind their back but knew too much of their plans. She managed to survive the attack, but her cyberware was damaged beyond basic function, rendering her comatose yet aware of her surroundings. The caretaker of CloudsOswald "Woodman" Forrestattempted to have her restored. After no success he raped her, taking advantage of her unconscious body. After no longer being able to provide what he was after, he decided to pawn her off toripperdocFingersfor one last attempt to fix her cyberware. When Fingers failed, Woodman wrote Evelyn off and left her with the ripperdoc as payment. Fingers eventually contacted hisfixer,Wakako Okada, and sold Evelyn off to theScavengersto be used in the production of black market snuff BDs. However, after recognizing the potential of Evelyn's high-end doll and BD cyberware, they instead kept her alive through multiple BDs, forcing her to endure unspeakable situations one after another.[7][8]
Evelyn was eventually located by her friend Judy, with help from V, in an abandoned power plant, but she remained in a comatose state. From there, she was taken toJudy's apartmentto remain under her care. Although her condition slowly improved, Evelyn was not able to overcome the events which had transpired and committed suicide in Judy's bath tub while she was gone. Prior to Evelyn's death, Judy managed to recover additional braindance recordings from her memories, including the multiple rapes by Woodman, the brutal abuse that she suffered from Scavengers, as well as the fragments of her dealings with the Voodoo Boys.[8][4][9]
Evelyn was cremated and interred at theColumbarium. Her epitaph reads: "She died valiantly fighting the system."[2]

Solomon Reedis aSolo/Lawmanand a major character inCyberpunk 2077:Phantom Liberty.
Reed is a tall, dark and masculine individual of African descent with short hair, goatee with a connected mustache (a circle beard), and visible cyberware in his temples and neck. He tends to wear a long, dark leather jacket with a red lining inside and a shirt underneath. He wears a long necklace with a circular pendant.
In 2079, Reed seemingly has more cyberware in his hands and arms; with his fingers completely replaced by chrome.
Solomon Reed was a member of theNUSA SpecOps. His unit, includingMaine, was deployed in South America, where they burned down local villages.[4]
At some point during his life, Solomon Reed joined theNUSAFederal Intelligence Agency, having extreme loyalty and a deep sense of duty to his country. His countless covert intelligence missions made him an expert at uncovering spies andnetrunners, information extraction, and breaking into the most secure locations.[5][6]
Song So Micaught the attention of the FIA and was shortly thereafter recruited. She became Reed's trainee and protégé.[7]At some point, Solomon also recruitedbraindanceactressAlexto join the FIA.[8]
During theUnification War, Reed led the FIA cell operating in Night City, which amongst others included Songbird and Alex. Reed and his agents carried out numerous covert operations in the city, primarily against the Free States-alignedArasakacorporation. As the war progressed, however, more and more of Reed's soldiers were being eliminated by the enemy, and the cell gradually decreased in strength.[9]Early in the war, he contacted his old SpecOps partner Maine to build a spy network in the city for NUSA, but he declined.[4]Near the war's end in 2070, PresidentMyersordered Reed to dismantle his operation and return home, calling off his last mission of neutralizingMurata Ozuru, an admiral of the Arasaka Corporation.
On their last day in NC, to the surprise of Reed and So Mi, Ozaru and his family were killed in anAVsabotage. Despite the circumstances, Reed decided to proceed with evacuating the last FIA agent remaining in NC,Jonas Collinson. So Mi told him that Jonas would not think twice about abandoning them, to which Reed replied not to worry about it. Before leaving, So Mi told him that if he needed anything, he should contact her before she left the city as well. She also told him to remember that honor did not exist in Night City. Reed told her she was probably right.
After confirming the location of Jonas in theNo-Tell Motel, Solomon went into his room only to find his colleague tied to a chair in the bathroom. An Arasaka assassin was waiting for him right around the corner, but thanks to Jonas' muffled warnings, Solomon swiftly dealt with him, and after untying his coworker, he punched him. Solomon was convinced the death of Ozuru and his family were Jonas' doing, to which he replied that only Ozuru was supposed to be there, prompting Reed to quote that they should always gather intel and wait before proceeding with a mission, spitting out he should have left Jonas to Arasaka. The young agent admitted the blame, saying he did it only to impress Solomon. Despite Jonas' incompetence, Reed proceeded with the evacuation. At a parking lot, both agents rendezvous with the extraction vehicle, whom refused to take two passengers as they had only paid for one. Reed gave his place to Jonas, who was very grateful to his senior, stating he was a good man. With no plan to leave NC, Solomon contacted So Mi, sending her his coordinates in hopes she would find a way out. At that moment, a surveillance camera identified him. Soon after, a squad of Arasaka troops appeared, though Solomon managed to escape. Finally, So Mi answered back, providing him with an escape plan.[1]
After finding a high vantage point, Solomon jumped onto a maglev train that was going towardsSouthern California, following So Mi's plan with full confidence. Once safely inside the train, Reed asked his friend about her own plans to ditch the city, to which she replied that the NUSA government was alreadysigningthe end of the war. This prompted Solomon to state with a smile that she was the President's favorite, and she deserved the easy way out of Night City since after all, she had saved his life. After a small banter about quesadillas, Solomon mentioned her there was a passenger carrying a gun, though So Mi did not answer back. Thinking he had been made out, Reed tried to exit the train car, only to find out it was shut close. Realizing So Mi's betrayal, Solomon tried to fend the attackers off on his own. He initially succeeded, but two Arasaka troopers eventually overpowered and shot him down.[1][10]
Solomon managed to somehow survive the encounter, got treatment for several months and was declared dead by the NUSA as a cover story, fed even to his closest colleagues (including Alex). It was later revealed that Solomon's death was one of Arasaka's conditions to agree to a ceasefire with the NUSA, to which President Myers agreed, ordering Songbird to orchestrate the death of her mentor.[9]Despite being sold out by his own government, Reed accepted this betrayal as "part of the job" and remained loyal to the NUSA, becoming an FIAsleeper agentin Night City.[11]
Reed worked as a bouncer at theElectric Orgasm, a bar owned byFixerDino Dinovic, to pay for his bills, as being an FIA sleeper agent did not come with a paycheck.
AfterSpace Force One's crash, Myers instructedmercenaryVto make contact with Reed via a specialized analogue telephone located in anabandoned restaurantin Dogtown. Reed meets V for the first time in a basketball court where they would discuss about Myers' welfare.
Reed helped Myers escape Dogtown and worked with V andAlexto rescue Songbird fromHansen's grasp.
At some time during the rescue, Reed found out about Songbird's situation with regards to theBlackwallslowly taking her life, where he vowed to help Songbird with the condition that he must talk to her in person, which he suspects Songbird might not want to do as she had other plans on rescuing herself. Because of this suspicion, Reed came up with the plan to disable Songbird with a high tech ICEbreaker guaranteed to fight against a netrunner as powerful as Songbird.

Song So Mi(송소미), more commonly known by her pseudonymSongbird, is a major character inCyberpunk 2077:Phantom Liberty.
Songbird is an exceedingly talentednetrunnerwho works as an intelligence analyst for theNUSA.[3]She is also the right hand of PresidentRosalind Myers. Her talent makes her one of the most valuable assets of the NUSA government to protect the country's precarious position.[6]
So Mi is a netrunner ofKoreandescent, with a height of approximately 5'4-5.[7]Her hair color varies on appearance, it's either magenta with orange highlights, or just magenta. She has brown eyes with red eye shadow. She can be seen wearing a uniqueEMP Threadingcyberwarepattern on her face.[3]
Song has a body modification made byMilitech, similar to Tier 5 technology used by elite netrunners, which allows her to function as self-dependent netrunning station. Her appearance through theRelicshows a glimpse of her past and presents her in custom colored netrunner suit with red to black ombré from top to bottom, and a custom new variant of thedenim jacketwithout two belts on her left sleeve. The jacket is gray-to-black gradient with a patch, four pins, one of which has theSamurailogo, and has a skeletal rib cage decal on the back. Her accessory of choice is a belt with studs to support hercyberdeck. To finish the outfit, she wears untied high-tops shoes. Over all appearance points atrockerfashion. This appearance is not heavily modified, however a netrunning port can be visible on the back of her head.[3]
Song So Mi was born on December 29th,2045. She grew up inNew York Cityalongside her mother, with no mention of a father.[1][8]Around the age of 13, So Mi convinced a localripperdocto sell her an old, worn-outcyberdeck. Ever since she was always diving onto theNet.[9]
During her teenage years, So Mi lived in anapartmentinBrooklyn, NYC. During that time, she had a few friends and a boyfriend namedLucas.[8]Song used to search for out-of-the-way places where she could jack in and steal her way into the Net. She also picked up the riskiest gigs she could find, improving hernetrunnerabilities along the way, and despite her unsuccessful results, from time to time she managed to pull off some of those gigs. In2063or2064, she hacked aBiotechnicafermentation facility inOregon.[9]
At the age of 19, So Mi caught the attention of theFIAafter breaching aMilitechdatafortby using their base inAnkaraas a proxy.NetWatcheventually caught her, though she barely managed to escape. Militech mapped her signal at the last second, and despite the plans to flatline her, FIA AgentSolomon Reedspoke against it, instead proposing to recruit her.[1][10]Reed was sent to New York with that task in mind, though Song declined his offer. To convince her, Reed mentioned that after the stunt she had tried to pull, NetWatch would not only target her, but the people she cared for as well; as such, only he and the FIA could avoid that outcome. Song took that as blackmail, and despite her initial refusal, she eventually accepted. The young netrunner left her old life behind and departed from Brooklyn with Reed.[8]On their way out of the city, So Mi did not look sad but refused to look back at her home, saying that Reed had seemingly saved her life. Solomon knew she did not believe those words.[11]
At some point afterwards, So Mi swore theNUSAoath to PresidentRosalind Myers, officially becoming an FIA agent.[8]She was given the codename Songbird,[12]and became Reed's trainee and protégé.[13]Shortly after these events, Song So Mi was publicly declared deceased and a gravestone was set at Calvary in New York City.[14]
Songbird's first mission was inColombiaalongside fellow agents Reed andAlex.[1]Once the assignment was completed, President Myers granted So Mi with a badge of honor as a reward. Song gave the medal to a homeless man on the street, who proceeded to pin it on his jacket and ask for spare change.[11]
So Mi, Reed and Alex went to visit her grave in New York City once. They laid some flowers and poured whiskey over it.[14]
Over the years, Songbird's talent cemented her position as President Myer's right hand.[4]
During theUnification War, Reed, Songbird, among other FIA agents were sent undercover toNight City. They were present duringKurt Hansen's mission inPacifica. Song had an apartment not far fromTranquil TerraceinSerenisands. She often spent her time on one of the terraces, observing the city and its people from a viewpoint, and cherishing the memories of her old home in Brooklyn.[1]
In2070, during the end the war, So Mi and Reed had their last mission to neutralizeMurata Ozuru, an admiral of theArasaka Corporation. Before they could proceed with their assignment, President Myers called them off and to return to the NUSA. Over the course of the dismantling of the FIA operations in Night City, three agents were murdered.
On their last day in NC, to the surprise of Reed and So Mi, Ozaru and his family were killed in anAVsabotage. Despite the circumstances, Reed decided to proceed with evacuating the last FIA agent remaining in NC,Jonas Collinson. So Mi told him that Jonas would not think twice about abandoning them, to which Reed replied not to worry about it. Before leaving, So Mi told him that if he needed anything, he should contact her before she left the city as well. She also told him to remember that honor did not exist in Night City. Reed told her she was probably right.
After helping Jonas leave NC, Solomon was left with no plan to leave the city. As such, he contacted So Mi, sending her his coordinates in hopes she would find a way out. She eventually provided him with an escape plan.[15]
After finding a high vantage point, Solomon jumped onto a maglev train that was going towardsSouthern California, following So Mi's plan with full confidence. Once safely inside the train, Reed asked his friend about her own plans to ditch the city, to which she replied that the NUSA government was alreadysigningthe end of the war. This prompted Solomon to state with a smile that she was the President's favorite, and she deserved the easy way out of Night City since after all, she had saved his life. Following a small banter about quesadillas, Solomon mentioned to her that there was a passenger carrying a gun, though So Mi did not answer back. Thinking he had been made out, Reed tried to exit the train car, only to find out it was shut close. Although she had initially hesitated to do so, and was affected by the decision, So Mi betrayed her mentor by locking the door, trapping Solomon with a bunch of gangoons and Arasaka troopers that dealt with him.[15][16]
During the next years, So Mi continued to work under President Myers, carrying on her job as a netrunner for the Union.[16]Myers ordered Songbird to breach theBlackwallmultiple times, causing a toll on So Mi's life which forced her to increase thecyberwareshe had. She explains that it feels like slowly losing a part of herself, being taken over by something else.
On December the 22nd of2076, NetWatch managed to detect an attempt to breach the Blackwall, though they did not figure out it was Songbird.[1]
By2077, So Mi's body had deteriorated significantly from breaching the Blackwall, to the point that she was dying. Facing death, she decided to find a cure and escape from Myers' grasp. So Mi made a deal withHansenwho had the neutral matrix that could cure her, in exchange for Myers as a hostage.
President Myers, Songbird, and nine more crewmembers were traveling above the Californian coast on theSpace Force One. While Myers and So Mi were talking, a missile struck the spaceplane's wing, forcing it to go down.[16]Additionally, communications had been jammed and the spacecraft was being hacked, with its trajectory directly towards Night City'sDogtown. Songbird managed to contact a merc in Night City calledVthanks to theRelicthey possessed. She told them that aboard the spaceplane was the President of the New United States, and it was very likely it would crash in Night City. Convincing V to help them by revealing a potential solution for their problem, Songbird guided the merc into theEBM Petrochem Stadium, from where they would get a good view of the situation.[9]Unexpectedly, Hansen had plans to kill Myers, choosing to shoot down the plane instead of grounding it. Shortly after getting on the top of the stadium, another missile struck into the plane, cutting all communications and killing all nine crewmembers. So Mi got President Myers into the spaceplane's saferoom, knowing she would survive the crash. So Mi herself barely managed to get into the emergency lifepod, and after passing right above the stadium, the lifepod got ejected, falling on the eastern side of Dogtown, while the Space Force One crashed-landed on the western side.[17]
After surviving the landing, So Mi guided V to rescue Myers from the crash site.[17]During this event, she hacks onto a decommissionedChimerato protect V and Myers, where she would be disabled and captured byHansen.
Myers employs V and Reed to rescue Songbird, which eventually was revealed to be partnered with Hansen who Songbird plans to betray in order to steal aBlackwallAI housed in a neural matrix, found in an undergroundMilitechbunker. Knowing full well that Hansen would kill her once he had the data, So Mi made plans to escape.

If V decides to help Reed and betrays Songbird:
So Mi lived a happy life inBrooklyn, surrounded by her friends, who used to support her work. However, when So Mi became more occupied by suicidal gigs, her ambition blinded her to the effort and care her closest ones showed by keeping her alive. Due to this, she became distant from those who loved her the most.[8]
As she took on more dangerous jobs, So Mi eventually found herself in trouble after hackingMilitech's fortress. This put her on the radar of bothNetWatchandPresident Myers, who believed she could use So Mi's talent for personal gain.Agent Reedwas sent to persuade nineteen-year-old So Mi to join theFederal Intelligence Agency. She didn't agree at first, not wanting to leave everything she loves behind, until Reed used blackmail on her, saying that he could protect her friends, or So Mi can let them be killed by NetWatch.[8]
In the FIA So Mi lost all her autonomy and personality. She had to play according to the plan FIA gave her. This led her to be in bigger danger than she would ever imagine rather than be safe as Reed promised. So Mi became nothing more, than just another weapon in Myers' eyes who used her to break international laws governing cyberspace use.[18]Songbird was forced into penetrating theBlackwalland used its results to giveNUSAthe upper hand toward potential enemies. However, those actions had consequences on no one else but So Mi herself, as the deeper she reached, the more of her body started to fail, resulting in a full-cyborg transformation and her mind being infected by Rogue AIs from beyond the Blackwall.[8]
To fight for her life, So Mi came up with an ambitious but naive plan of exchanging Rosalind Myers' life for the AI neural matrix thatKurt Hansenhad, leading to the attack onSpace Force One.[19]

Rosalind Myersis the third and current president of theNew United States of America, the former CEO ofMilitech, and a formermarine. Currently serving her third term, Myers is the second woman serving as president in the short history of the NUSA, continuing her gospel of unification.
Despite coming from corporate and political backgrounds, Rosalind shows a "commoner" attitude while carrying herself. Thus, as the politician she is, it may be part of the play, as she will do anything to get your vote. However, Myers also reveals her cold-blooded side, not particularly when it's necessary. To her, ends justify the means.
Rosalind expresses her status as a high politician as well as an ex-marine in the choice of wardrobe. Her ivory collarless jacket with gold accents resembles the iconic formal wear of women coming from generational wealth, while the golden plate on her shoulder looks like anepaulette- a decoration used as insignia of rank by armed forces.
Myers also shows herself in disguise where she wears a black outfit consisting of a turtleneck, denim vest, jeans, and a cap with "I <3NC" that she found in the hideout. DespiteVmentioning the awful smell of the clothes she did what's necessary to hide her identity from the citizens ofDogtown.[4]
After V cuts out the subdermal tracking device, this leaves a scar on Myers' neck.[5]
After the death ofMilitech's CEODonald Lundee, Rosalind Myers became his successor in leading the corporation. She was described as a proponent of peace and a distinguished politician that oversaw the NUSA's rapid economy recovery,[6]while also having an interventionist and protectionist stance. Myers was CEO of Militech for almost a decade.[7]
In2065, after leaving her former position at Militech toLucas Harford, Rosalind Myers was elected as the third President of the New United States of America. During her next campaign for reelection, President Myers presented a unification program to extend federal rule over theFree Statesunder the pretense of strengthening the Union, though most of them opposed this unification. In January2069, once Myers had been reelected, the NUSA and Militech instigated the conflict that became known as theUnification Warto annex the remaining Free States that opposed Myers' program.[8][9]
In2070, after capturing most of the Free States, the NUSAmoved into take overNight City, but failed due toArasaka's intervention.[8][10][9]FIAagentsSolomon ReedandSong So Miwere in the city, but were called off by the President herself.[11]Not wanting the war to escalate into a global conflict, Myers had little choice but to sign theArvin Accordwith the Free States to bring the war to an early conclusion in June 2070, not succeeding in fully annexing them under the NUSA's banner, but forcing the Free States to get more involved with the Union — with the exception theRepublic of Texas.[8][9]
By2077, Rosalind Myers was serving her third term as president.[12]Opinion of Myers in Night City was divided. Many people viewed her as a corrupt, corporate-backed fascist with imperialist delusions, while others pointed to Night City's crime rate being double than that of anywhere in the NUSA and argued in favor of accepting Myers' control.[9][13]During this time, President Myers ordered the bombing of Texan airbases in Wellington and El Paso in retaliation for suicide bombings at the NUSA bases inNew MexicoandOklahoma, raising the odds of a border war with the Republic of Texas. Myers also issued a public statement — the contents of which were not specified — about the flow of refugees into the NUSA from the floodingNetherlandsinEurope.[14]
AfterSaburo Arasaka's passing, Myers stated that all accusations Arasaka had claimed against Militech and the NUSA of being the ones that orchestrated his death were all unfounded and irresponsible. She warned that in the past they had reminded the former CEO that he was not omnipotent, and that if necessary, she would not hesitate to teach his successor,Yorinobu Arasaka, the same lesson. She went on to say that despite having respected theArvin Accordso far, both the NUSA and Militech would respond in full force if provoked.[14]
At the 2077 Federalist Party convention, Myers announced that she would seek a fourth term in office. Her campaign slogan was unveiled to be "A Return to Unity", emphasizing her commitment to unification across all fronts.[14][15]
President Myers, Song So Mi, and nine other crew and staff, were traveling above the Californian coast on theSpace Force One. While Myers and So Mi were talking, a missile struck right into the spaceplane's wing, forcing it to go down.[16]Additionally, communications had been jammed and the spacecraft was being hacked, with its trajectory directly towards Night City'sDogtown.

Hansen is the unofficial leader of Dogtown and the commander ofBARGHEST. His military background doesn't mean he just acts in violence, as Hansen's keen intellect and strategic prowess make him a formidable rival to his enemies.[4]To some, Hansen is simply a gangster or a terrorist, while others see him as a charismatic leader that was able to create a paradise safe from corporate and police influence.[5]
Born in theNew United States of America(blood type A+),[6]Hansen was a member of a juvenile gang before enlisting in the Militech Armed Forces after reaching the age of majority (ID 47 32 688 215[2]), forwarded to the military academy later. He rose through the ranks at a rapid pace, demonstrating exceptional leadership and improvisation skills, reaching the rank of colonel at a very young age. He was deployed across the world in covert operations, setting up a broad network of contacts and assets with or without NUSA's sanction.[7]
In 2067, he was granted command of the Barghest urban combat and pacification unit. When theUnification Warbroke out, Hansen was given orders to secure a beachhead for further operations inNight City. Operation Midnight Storm came at the tall end of the Unification War. After Barghest managed to establish a forward operating base at theEBM Petrochem StadiuminPacifica, the impending assault on the city was called off and Hansen was ordered to retreat on June 9, 2070. Hansen and the entire Barghest unit refused to obey these new orders.[2]
Ignoring theArvin Accord, Hansen had his own plans. Using his extensive experience in complex operations, organizational and leadership skills, and interrogation tactics, Hansen established his own, private realm, backed by his loyal soldiers and vast amounts of military ordnance. A profitable black market operating outside corporate rule emerged, buttressing his rule, while the district became a haven for those wanting to disappear or live outside corporate rule - but at the price of teetering on the brink of poverty.[2][4][8]Controlled by Hansen'sBarghestmilitia, the worst areas of the Pacifica district became aCombat Zone, and at some point were walled off from the rest of the city.[9]Not much later Hansen would rename this area to Dogtown.[10]
After establishing the district'sBlack Market, gun trade and other unsavory dealings turned the former subdistrict of Pacifica into a very profitable business. As such, the powers-that-be decided to leave it alone, allowing Hansen to continue as its ruler[8]and keep the district going with the money from his large-scale smuggling operation.[5]
By2077, Colonel Hansen and his BARGHEST still ruled Dogtown with an iron fist.[4]At some point, he takes possession of a neural matrix andBlackwallAI found in an abandonedMilitechbunker. At some point prior to mid-June,[11]Hansen was contacted bySongbird, who offered to give him Myers in return for accessing the matrix. They arranged for her to crashSpace Force Onein Dogtown and for the BARGHEST to kill Myers.[12]However, Hansen intended to capture Songbird and use her for his own plans.[13]

Saburo Arasaka(荒坂 三郎), also known asthe Emperor, went from being an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service Pilot to the corporate God of the 21st century. Born inTokyo,Japanhe made theArasaka Corporationinto one of the largestcorporationsof the world. Saburo is proud, honorable and, like the true Samurai Shogun he claims to be, he's power hungry. Although he is ancient and physically decrepit, Saburo Arasaka remains the genius he always was in his younger years. Despite his age, Saburo never gave up his control over Arasaka. When his eldest son,Kei, became the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, Saburo remained the chairman of the board and the true puppeteer behind all the major corporate decisions.[1]
Saburo, after decades of building up the Arasaka Corporation, focused his efforts towards bioengineering and mind preserving technology. He even made a copy of his person into anengraminMikoshiat theArasaka HeadquartersinTokyo. At the age of 158, he still reigned at the top of Arasaka in the year2077, having built Arasaka into a great empire in his generation. He's proud, honorable, ruthless and more hungry for power than ever.[2]
Saburo Arasaka was born toSasaiandYui ArasakainTokyo,Japanin 1919 – a family that could trace their lineage back to the noble samurai of old. His parents were rich and his father was a shrewd businessman and was the founder of theArasaka companyin 1915. He grew up in theArasaka family estatelocated just outside of Tokyo and from a young age was involved in the family business. In the 1930s, as a young adult he displayed a good work ethic and natural talent needed to be an exceptional manager. This was before his career was interrupted byWorld War II.[3]
During this, Saburo enlisted as a pilot in theImperial Japanese Navy, orNihon Kaigun(日本海軍). He quickly rose through the ranks and by the age of 23 he had already attained the rank of Lieutenant.[3]As a skilled flying ace he had over 20 confirmed kills and was said to have a fierce pride towards his country and undying loyalty to hisEmperor.[1]
In 1942, Saburo was among the Zero pilots escorting a flight of Japanese G4M"Betty" bombersout of Rabaul island on a routine bombing run over Gualdcanal. When they were engaged by a number AmericanGrumman F4F, theZero fightersbroke formation to engage them. In the subsequent pitched air battle, Saburo passed through an enemy's line of fire while weaving in pursuit of his second kill for the day. He wasn't vulnerable long enough to be shot down, but several bullets smashed through the canopy, shattering his left arm and driving splinters of perspex and metal into his left eye and skull. Barely conscious, he let his fighter plummet towards the ground fifteen thousand feet below. Precious seconds later Saburo struggled back to awareness only to see the ground rushing towards him. Despite the punishing pain and the loss of the use of one arm he pulled back on his stick, leveled his plane and regained control with only a scant 2000 feet to spare. Then, patching himself up as best he could, he began the long haul back to Rabaul, fully believing that he would die somewhere over the 560 miles of ocean he had to cross.
Despite his injuries, Saburo managed to land his plane and reported to his commander. After delivering his report he passed out and was transported back toTokyobefore he regained consciousness, where he discovered that due to his injuries he would never be able to fly again and he was also due to be medically discharged. His injuries were so severe that he was permanently blind in his left eye and that his left arm, although not amputated, was damaged beyond use. Saburo lamented over his injuries and wished he had died a dignified death over the skies of Guadalcanal, rather than face the humiliation of a cripple. He was summarily discharged from service and returned to theArasaka family compound, where he spent his days brooding over his loss. Saburo saw how the Empire he defended suffered more and more defeats over the next few years.[3]
On August 15th 1945, the day of theJapanese surrender, as the Emperor addressed the people and made note of their surrender, Saburo was thunderstruck. He was on the verge ofseppukuin the compound's cherry tree grove. Before the blade was able to puncture his stomach he had a moment of epiphany, and with it came a vision. Right at that moment, Saburo saw the wisdom of his father's actions. Sasai had foreseen Japan's loss in the war. He originally capitalized on wartime industry, but against Saburo's impassioned urging, he had made sure that the bulk of the Arasaka fortune was covertly protected in concealed overseas assets and accounts. As family scion, Saburo saw that the fortune would soon be his to control. He envisioned aJapanrising above the humiliation of losing the war, and becoming an economic powerhouse. A nation in a position of power from which it could dominate the world politically and economically. Saburo drew the half inch of dagger that had penetrated his abdominal muscles before the vision had stayed his hand and returned to the household.
From the day Saburo nearly took his own life, he refused to speak of his wartime experience.[3]Saburo devoted his complete attention to his work. He began intense studies into the fields of politics, economics and history to become a worthy successor to his father and to ensure that Arasaka would one day dominate the political and economic climate.[1]
In 1960, Sasai Arasaka passed away and Saburo took his father's place as the new CEO of Arasaka at the age of 41. He branched out from the simple manufacturing company that it started as and started the Arasaka Bank division. In 1970, he then created the Arasaka Security division of the the family business. Saburo also began shaping the development of the Arasaka Corporation to his own ideals. He was not content with the power that came from purely financial and commercial strength. If his vision ofJapanas the world economic superpower was to be realized he would have to exert unseen political control in Japan and across theworld. Despite it being a long, arduous task, he believed he was the man to do it. Banking and Security along with Manufacturing were now the three pillars of theArasaka Corporation.
Being such a dedicated worker, Saburo was late in actually marrying or having children that could continue his legacy after he passed. In 1980, Saburo and his then wife had their first childKei, a boy he groomed to eventually take over the corporation. Saburo's first wife had passed away at some point and he later remarried.
In 1990, because of his direction the Arasaka Corporation emerged on the global 500 list. During the 1990s, Saburo kept busy as he was able to foresee the world marketCrash of '94and the subsequentUScollapseof 1996, using these events to his advantage. This made the Arasaka Corporation one of the few that benefited from the crash, gaining the number two spot on the global 500. He also became more involved in politics, backing politicians in theJapanese Governmentto further benefit his interests.[4]
Saburo even elevated the Defense Agency of Japan into the Ministry of defense under his influence, which in turn benefited his corporation. During this he also attempted to reduce the power of thecivilian police, which were controlled by other competitors of Arasaka. This reduction of police power became a very lucrative opportunity for Arasaka Police to grow, which became one of the services offered by Arasaka Security. Major cities in Japan became under the protection of the Arasaka policing services, except for Tokyo.
Saburo became a man of the people, known for being a huge contributor to the development ofcountry. He was also well-known overseas providing thousands of Americans with reliable work, often visiting the people in factories or the streets.[3]He manage to secure much wealth with the Arasaka European Group, when itsheadquarterswere constructed in Paris,France.
Saburo also remarried in the early 1990s, to his third wifeMichiko Arasaka, while together they had two children,YorinobuandHanako. Michiko passed away shortly after having Hanako due to complications during birth, leaving Saburo to raise them. Hanako became the "apple of his eye" and he wished to protect her from the dangers of the outside world. Yorinobu was put through to the best schools in Tokyo, while Hanako was home-schooled by people Saburo trusted.[1]
During the time after he sustained injuries, Saburo had undergone numerous surgeries to implant various cybernetics as well as a new eye and right arm for the ones he lost in World War 2. However, by 2020, at 101 years of age, he handed the reins of the company to his eldest sonKei. He remained an influential figure in the corporation and would still attend board meetings.
DuringYorinobu'sgraduation fromTodai, Saburo brought his son to his office during the ceremony and told him everything about the family corporation, explaining it's success and their long term goals. Yorinobu, however, did not share his father's ideals and left that same night. Months later he discovered Yorinobu had started a bosozoku gang to rebel and fight against his corporation. This deeply saddened Saburo – as a result,Hanakowas never told this truth and instead was kept inside the family compound. Kei was upset at his brother's betrayal and told his father that he needed to be destroyed as he was a risk to their operations. Saburo reluctantly agreed knowing that Kei was right.
Saburo still participated in Japanese politics and would soon found a foothold, allowing him to achieve some political influence. Despite Kei becoming the CEO, Saburo still ran the company from behind the scenes, having the final say over project they needed done.[4]
In 2013, as theArasaka Corporationwas building their newheadquartersinNight City. Saburo discovered anetrunnernamedAlt Cunninghamwho had been working forITS. He found out about a program calledSoulkillerthat she had designed for ITS, believing this was a valuable resource for Arasaka he orderedToshiro, the American division CEO, to find Alt and have her recreate the Soulkiller for them. As a result the Arasaka American branch suffered from an assault which resulted in the death of Toshiro. Saburo had Kei fill in his position as the new CEO of the Arasaka American branch as Saburo ran things from Tokyo. Now in posession of the Soulkiller program, Saburo began funding projects for new versions of it.
During theFourth Corporate War, the Arasaka Corporation faced off againstMilitech, a corporation Saburo grew to hate due to its CEODonald Lundeereminding him of the American pilot who shot his plane down in the war.[5]Lundee had put himself and Militech up against Arasaka for years, as Saburo grew tired of him. However, Saburo gave full control over to his son Kei, as he ran the war effort fromNight City. Yorinobu, unbeknownst to his father, worked with theJapanese Governmentto nationalize Arasaka, which soon cut off Saburo from Kei, costing them the war.[6]
In the immediate aftermath of the nuclear bomb detonation in theArasaka Towers, Saburo seemingly met with the terrorist behind the bombing:Johnny Silverhand, based on the recollection of an engram. Silverhand had been apparently captured byAdam Smasherduring his escape from the Tower, and was evacuated before the nuke went off. In an attempt for interrogation Saburo had Silverhand's mind copied withSoulkiller, seemingly killing him--in reality Silverhand was killed by Smasher on the spot, and his engram was soulkilled by the netrunnerSpider Murphy. For reasons unknown, the engram wound up inMikoshiand the true identities of the perpetrators of the bombing were left unknown for decades.[2]
Saburo later attended a funeral for his son Kei, while mourning his loss he was reunited withYorinobu. With the aid of Hanako, Saburo and Yorinobu reconciled and the family was brought together again.
After the death of his son,Kei, theArasaka Corporationbecame under the nominal control of Saburo once again, although he kept the face of corporation under his eldest daughterHanako Arasaka. As of the 2040s, there were three major factions struggling to achieve control of the company, hoping that the aging Saburo, at 126, would eventually hand the crown over to them. The factions at hand were: The Kiji 雉 faction led by Hanako (though controlled by Saburo), The Taka 鷹 faction led byYorinobu, and finally the Hato 鳩 faction centered onMichiko(Kei's daughter and Saburo's granddaughter). Despite speculation over who would reign as the next leader of Arasaka, Saburo was hellbent on remaining in control.[7]
During this time, Saburo spent much of his time in med tanks designed to regenerate organic tissue. He also invested heavily into bioengineering and mind preserving technology. This would be his answer to eternal life. TheRelic projectbegan with the director of the projectAnders Hellmanbeing it's lead designer. Saburo got to know Anders well during this and even began a personal project of the Relic that would house theengramof a person and be able to transfer it into a new body.
In 2077, Saburo at the age of 158, remained in firm control of Arasaka as its CEO. He had been working on aRelicprototype as he took much interest in the project. His son,Yorinobu, stole the Relic from one of his laboratories because of his long-term rebellion against him. Saburo was later notified byAnders Hellmanof his son's betrayal. He then set sail with his daughterHanakoon theKujiraforNight Cityto confront Yorinobu. Hanako was the only one who knew of his reasons for leavingTokyo. During the trip Hanako tried convincing Saburo that she should be the one to speak to her brother or at least accompany him. After declining her she asked what he intended to do, a question Saburo himself did not have an answer to.[8]
Saburo finally arrived at Yorinobu's suite inKonpeki Plazaon the same night that the mercenariesVandJackie Wellesinfiltrated the hotel to steal the Relic forEvelyn Parker. With the two thieves looking on in secret from a concealed location, Saburo spoke with his son, but Yorinobu snapped and strangled him to death. In a few short moments, the long life of the man renowned and feared around the world as "the Emperor" ended.[2]
Yorinobu moved quickly to consolidate control of Arasaka, and blamed Saburo's murder onTakemura, Saburo's bodyguard. Word of Saburo's death reached the public within minutes; officially, Arasaka claimed his unexpected demise was attributed to natural causes.[2]
Saburo Arasaka after his death his engram was activated and he met with Hanako at some point after her kidnapping. Hanako had told him ofV, a mercenary that might be willing to help them expose Yorinobu of his crimes. Saburo informed his daughter that they should offer V help in exchange for them helping them. He also wished to meet with V before they began their plans.
In the epilogues where Arasaka is hurt and Yorinobu is successful sabotaging the corporation:
If V asked Hanako for help inNocturne Op55N1:
Saburo is an obsessive megalomaniac. He is highly arrogant and considers himself the most adept man that has and will ever exist, and sees it as his duty to elevate Japan to what he believes to be its former glory. He works tirelessly to see this ideal come true. His family believes his dedication to his work is the thing that keeps him alive. Saburo concentrated so hard on building his Empire that he did not even begin having children until he was in his 60s. He firmly believes in the traditional Japanese values and enforces them rigidly at the family compound. He also maintains a classical decor inside the compound, dismissing any non-functional modern appointing.[1]
In spite of being a cold and dangerous, Saburo always believed himself to be a good person because he had a very elevated goal in mind: restoring the glory of his country and ensuring the happiness and security of his family, he wasn't looking for glory for himself. Saburo was also a very religious man and practices the traditions of theShintō faith.
Saburo by 2020 held the unofficial title of the most powerful man on the planet. The Arasaka lineage consisted of noble samurai, and because of this Saburo is incredibly proud and honorable, and after Imperial Japan's humiliating defeat in WW2 he vowed to restore his honor by seppuku. His unsuccessful attempt on August 15th 1945, during Emperor Hirohito's surrender speech to the nation, made him realize thatJapanwould never become the militaristic power it once was, but rather it could evolve into an economic and commercial power that could rule East Asia once again and possibly the world. Saburo began to study to one day take control over his father's company and to use his vast amounts of wealth to catapult the Arasaka Corporation onto the world stage.[1]
Saburo strived for perfection and studied at the top University of Tokyo,Todai, he graduated with expertise in economics, business, politics, and various others. He is one of the most intelligent men on the planet. Saburo is also very nationalistic, having a contemptful view of foreign countries and cultures, rarely setting foot outside of Japan. More specifically, Saburo harbors a deep hatred towards theUnited Statesfor humiliating his country during the war. Saburo uses three key areas of his company as tools to further his plans: the security division, the bank and the secretive black operations.
Within a month of his father's passing, black operations such as blackmail, bribery, extortion, assassination and abduction were already underway. These black operations usually uncovered compromising material on important figures such as politicians, celebrities and other corporate types, which Saburo uses against them—never for money—but for influence and information. As well as these black operations the company uses its security division to steal information from its own clients, who it had sworn to protect. The corporation has never been caught and the data stolen is not sold on for profit, but rather for Saburo to use the trends in the data to influence business decisions for the most profitable outcome. The bank is primarily used as a bargaining tool against other corporations that may be failing and need a previous load to stay afloat, but it has been known to be used for money laundering between Arasaka and the dummy corporations it owns.[1]

Yorinobu Arasaka(Japanese:荒坂 頼宣) is a major character inCyberpunk.
The second son toSaburo Arasakaand first son toMichiko Arasaka, Yorinobu is the rebelliousbōsōzokuleader of theSteel Dragons. Although a sworn bōsōzoku leader rockerboy, he eventually became the heir to theArasakaempire after the death of his elder brotherKei. Yorinobu disagreed with everything his father set out to accomplished and abandoned everything because of it. He is passionate, caring, and determined more than anything else.
Yorinobu is the charismatic counter toJohnny SilverhandinTokyo(though he does not play in a band). He was known to rally up the Japanese public to rebel against the corporate overlords. Yorinobu still cared for his sisterHanakoand would frequently speak with her behind their father's back, swearing one day to save her. In2077, Yorinobu still rebels against his father, but has not seen him in decades. However, he soon realized that the corporate giant's power was impossible to defeat — at least from the outside.[3]
Yorinobu was born in September 8, 1995 toSaburoandMichiko ArasakainTokyo,Japan. From a young age he was given the riches and benefits of any Arasaka family member would get, including the best education in the country. Growing up alongside his sisterHanakothey were happy being within theArasaka family compound. Yorinobu was raised with a blissful ignorance towards his fathers corporation. Something Saburo thought was important to keep secret until he was ready.
The day after the 21-year-old Yorinobu graduated fromTodai, Saburo brought him to his private chambers at the compound. His father, proud of his accomplishment, explained to him the true nature of theArasaka Corporation. Rather than agreeing with his father's vision, as his elder half-brotherKeihad, Yorinobu was secretly appalled and chose to stay silent as his father kept speaking. That night, after a celebratory dinner given in his honor, Yorinobu slipped out of the compound and vanished into the Tokyo night.[citation needed]Knowing what went on within the corporation, he hated what his father was trying to accomplish and vowed to stop him, while also wanting to save his sister from being involved.
Four years later, Yorinobu had gathered a cadre of tough Tokyo nomads (Bōsōzoku): 'Kotetsu no Ryu', orSteel Dragons. The bōsōzoku had sworn to expose Arasaka and fight for its demise. At night, they would prowl the canyons of the city, harassing Arasaka employees and unearthing information on Arasaka black operations. Yorinobu's knowledge of Arasaka facilities and corporate procedures gave the Steel Dragons some advantages, but they still lacked the power or information to make serious headway against the corporation. He was, however, able to tread the world of the street and the corporate tower with equal facility. When he wasn't riding with his men, he was travelling the world; meeting with other enemies of Arasaka and looking for funds and equipment. Slowly but surely his operation was growing.
Saburo loved his son, and was greatly saddened by his disloyalty, but acknowledged that Yorinobu needed to be dealt with as he threatened the corporation. Kei, who hated Yorinobu for his defection, had sworn to kill his half-brother. Hanako, on the other hand, still loved her brother. She and Yorinobu had always felt a special bond with each other. Although she was unaware of it at the time, he had sworn to free her from their father's clutches. Once a month, Yorinobu and Hanako secretly communicated through the net, reaffirming their fraternal love for one another.[4]
Yorinobu would visitNight Cityto gather information from his contacts. During one of Arasaka's sweeps on the city, some of Yorinobu's local contacts were taken prisoner, interrogated, and eventually executed. One of these contacts wasHiraga, who knew the identities of many high-ranking officials and suppliers to the Steel Dragons. The information obtained about the nomad clan was stored at theArasaka TowersinNight City. Before it could be sent to Kei at theTokyo Headquarters, Yorinobu had a contact intercept the data. With the data was an order for the assassination of high-ranking Steel Dragon officials. His contact's activity was traced down and they had to commitseppukuafter destroying the data to avoid capture. Unfortunately, the regional security director of Arasaka,Iwasao Koremichi, supposedly had a hard copy with the data.
During theFourth Corporate War, Yorinobu took further action to disrupt Arasaka's operations. Despite attempts fromMilitechto lure him to their side, he refused to join them. Instead, he played a role in supplying info to thegovernment of Japanthat helped their nationalization of Arasaka's assets. However, even after the damage from the war and the terrorist attack on Arasaka Tower in Night City, he saw it still wasn't enough to destroy the corporation. Yorinobu learned that it if Arasaka was to be destroyed, it must be from within.[5]
After the war ended, Yorinobu attended Kei's funeral. It was here he reconciled with his father. With the help of his sister, he was slowly welcomed back into the family.
In 2045, Yorinobu led the Taka (鷹) Faction of theArasaka Corporation. He made sure that during the War he was impossible to find and tried to reconcile with Saburo after. He still played the renegade game and opposed the other factions. As long as his father stayed in control under the Kiji (雉) Faction, Yorinobu would still be out there trying to bring about the corp's downfall — though this time he had planned to be more subtle than his previous schemes.[6]
Yorinobu was the original heir to the Arasaka Empire before he rebelled and cut ties with his father. For many years he led the Steel Dragons and sought destruction but soon realized that the corporate giant's power was impossible to defeat — at least from the outside.[3]By this point he hasn't spoken to Saburo in decades. In 2077, he was in contact withRonald Cheever, aNetWatchOperations Manager. The two discussed a cooperation that involved obtaining a sample of theRelicbiochip with a valid engram. Yorinobu saw an opportunity and stole aRelicprototype from one of his father's laboratories inTokyo. He then made sure the engram on the biochip was of Johnny Silverhand. After retreating toNight City, he was warned byAnders Hellmanthat the biochip was a prototype and was not ready for use in its current state. He eventually spoke with Hellman over the phone. This is when he warned Yorinobu to speak with his father before anything, as he was personally involved with the project.[7]
Saburo arrived in Night City shortly thereafter to retrieve what was stolen and to confront his son alone. In a fit of rage, Yorinobu murdered his father and later covered it up by claiming an assassin had his father poisoned. Yorinobu took full control of the Arasaka Corporation and began to make changes from within. His decisions started to take effect when he started removing facilities inFukuokaandKitakyushuinJapan. His plan to sabotage the corporation from within and undo much of what his father built had begun.[7]
Yorinobu participated in the parade to honor Saburo with the approval of Hanako and their niece,Michiko Arasaka. During the parade Hanako was kidnapped and he worked quickly to rescue her with his chief of security,Adam Smasher. After successfully rescuing his sister, Yorinobu made a public statement that anyone who would harm a member of the Arasaka family would be punished.[7]
He decided to order his faction to keep an eye on Hanako and keep her safe in theArasaka Estate,North Oak. Yorinobu later called an emergency meeting of the Arasaka supervisor board in Night City. Top executives from Tokyo, as well as branch directors fromParis,Shanghai, and Kinshasa all met in theArasaka Towerof theAmerican Division headquarters. Yorinobu had a plan for a military coup that would give him and those loyal to his faction complete control of Arasaka for his plan of sabotage. Part of his plan also involved his factions in Night City,Kyoto,Dubai, and Paris. The troops loyal to Yorinobu were ordered to destroy all other factions within the corporation as well as to remove the board of directors to gain complete control.[7]
In the epilogues where Arasaka is hurt and Yorinobu is successful sabotaging the corporation:
If V took Hanako's offer inNocturne Op55N1:
If V chose "The Tower" ending:
Yorinobu Arasaka — since his father spoke to him about the secrets of his company and his ambitions — has never lost sight of his goal, to bring down Arasaka. As Yorinobu distanced himself from his father he grew to hate him. When Saburo saw someone as a foe he would remove them without mercy and believed the end justified the means, this was a way of living Yorinobu could never abide by. The fear his father brought upon people was his greatest strength and Yorinobu knew this and was one of the few who did not fear him. To put an end to what he believed was Saburo's tyrannical goals he started gangs withinTokyo(Steel Dragons,Iron Lotus), the bōsōzoku gangs' goals were to expose the operations of Arasaka (as well as other megacorps) and destroy the areas that would weaken the megacorp's operations.
However, despite his battle and fighting among the Tokyo streets, Yorinobu was never satisfied with the results until finally the Arasaka Towers in Night City were destroyed by a mini nuke. He finally had realized nothing would be enough to stop Arasaka and his father. He left the Steel Dragons and went back to his family, this time wanting to destroy the megacorp from the inside. Yorinobu's sole purpose in life remained, to remove the fear his father brought onto the world.

Hanako is an intelligent woman who didn't agree with her father's ambitions and had her own agenda she planned to follow. Despite knowing what her father's wishes entailed with her, she still loved and didn't want to displease him.[5]
Her relationship with her brotherYorinobuis one of great importance to her. Through her strong and calm demeanor she is able to command and lead with great pride for her work. Hanako became the figurehead and CEO of the Corporation. Although her digital projects were what drove her, Hanako was the only one who understood Alt's work with theSoulkiller.[4]
Hanako Arasaka was born toMichiko ArasakaandSaburo Arasakaon March 2, 1999. Her mother died shortly thereafter due to complications caused by the birth. Due to this, she quickly became Saburo's favorite child.
Saburo was charmed by his little daughter's stunning beauty, and he decided to raise her in the sheltered confines of theArasaka Family Compoundto protect her from the scarring traumas of life in the exterior world. Hanako received her schooling at the compound through trusted tutors. Although she is a grown woman now, Hanako still only leaves the compound about once a month, and then only under heavy escort. Cut off from the outside world, she learned how to travel and explore the Net instead. Saburo made sure that Hanako was never made aware of the darker side of the corporation, but, through her Net explorations, Hanako was just beginning to suspect the horrible truth.
While Hanako would not leave the compound, the few times she would leave to see Tokyo she was escorted byShintaro Takayama, the chief of security of the compound, orKatsuo Iwashima, the second in command. Shintaro was like a second father to her and she trusted him more than most. Hanako was also delighted with his stories of ancientJapanhe would tell her while she was growing up. Katsuo would escort her when Shintaro was not available and her relationship with him was a pleasant one.
Hanako was a sweet and intelligent woman. She had been chafing under her father's well meaning restraint for several years, but she had never voiced her complaints. She knew that her father wanted to arrange her marriage in order to solidify a corporate alliance, but she secretly dreaded the day it would happen. Hanako never wished to hurt her father, but she had sworn to live an independent life after he died. Hanako's relationship with her older half-brotherKeiwas strained. While Kei adored Hanako and would do anything for her, she found him cold and threatening and never fully trusting him.[2]
Her closest family member wasYorinobu, her older rebellious brother of the same mother. Hanako and Yorinobu would regularly meet inthe Netwhile he rode with theSteel Dragons.
Hanako was not directly involved in theFourth Corporate War; she was kept under strict protection. During these years, Hanako spent most of her time inOsaka.[6]After the war ended, she attended the funeral of her eldest brother Kei, who had become a casualty of the fighting.Hanako and her father were surprised when Yorinobu used the funeral as an opportunity to ask for forgiveness. Thanks to her support, Yorinobu was accepted back into the family's fold.[3]
A highly skilledNetrunner, Hanako was of one few who grasped the true meaning ofAlt Cunningham's work. Having always been reclusive, she preferred to work on her digital projects, particularly on a revised version ofSoulkillerwith the aim of transferring engrams into clone bodies.However, after the death of Kei, the remainder of the Old Guard unified around her, forming the Kiji (雉) Faction. A group of conservative technocrats, they wanted to continue Saburo and Kei's plans, yet hoping for a peaceful reconciliation with theNUSA. While Hanako was the faction's figurehead, the degree of her involvement remains unclear.
At some point before 2070, Hanako opened a preserve on the island ofShikokufor the faction's name-giving animal, the last Japanese green pheasants (キジ).[7]
Together with her bodyguardSandayu Oda, Hanako accompanied her father Saburo on his trip on the aircraft carrierKujirafrom Japan toNight City, where he wanted to confront Yorinobu for stealing his personal commission — theRelic— from thelab. Concerned for him, she offered to accompany Saburo or speak to her brother herself, but the CEO declined both requests. On her question what he planned to do, he could not give her a good answer; however, he let himself be discouraged from annihilating Night City to avoid the talk.[8]
After Saburo's apparent death, Hanako agreed with her brother Yorinobu to give an eulogy[5]at the dashi float parade inJapantownduring Aratama-matsuri festival.[9]Shortly after her speech, Hanako was confronted by Saburo's former bodyguardGoro Takemura, who wanted to tell her about Yorinobu's involvement. When she wouldn't listen, he abducted her to an abandoned apartment building inVista del Rey, where he attempted to reason with her. Hanako refused this along with the offered tea. Only themercV, Takemura's ally and eyewitness to Saburo's death, was able to tell Hanako the truth: that her father had been killed by her brother. However, at that point of the conversation, Arasaka soldiers led by Adam Smasher burst into the building, securing Hanako and destroying the floor in the process.[10]
Upon returning to the Arasaka compound, Hanako sent a proxy to speak with V, who had gone into hiding in theSunset Motelin the aftermath of the parade. Having mistaken the rescue for an attempt at her life, she agreed to work together. Claiming that her hands were tied, she tasked the merc with acquiring a copy ofSoulkiller, then contact her on her private line. Depending on Takemura's fate, V either asks her about the bodyguard's whereabouts and is answered with a claim that he was in a secure location, or V scorned her for being responsible for Takemura's death by not listening earlier, something she rebukes them about, reminding them that he had done everything for this conversation to happen and as such demanded respect.[10]
Once the merc had acquired the necessary software, she summoned them to the luxury restaurantEmbers. When they arrived, Hanako explained the situation: from the start, the story of Saburo's poisoning had been disbelieved, yet no one (herself included) had been willing to stand against Yorinobu. She revealed she loved her brother too much to oppose him until she realized that he had tried to kill her. At this point, Hanako offered to save V's life in return for their testimony in front of Arasaka's board of directors. The conversation ended somewhat abruptly when she was called back to theArasaka EstateinNorth Oak,Westbrook.[11]

TheArasaka Corporation(Japanese:アラサカ社or荒坂社), is a world-widemegacorporationdealing in corporate security, banking, and manufacturing.[1]It is one of the most influential megacorporations in theworld.[4]The company is also the largest distributor ofJapanese-made merchandise throughout the American,European, and Asian markets. Arasaka-branded weapons and military vehicles are among the most sought after by police and security firms.[5]Over the years, it has developed a dark reputation as a corporation that is to be feared and one which covers its tracks using assassins, an army of lawyers, as well as an alleged connection to theYakuza.[6][7]
The Arasaka Corporation maintains the largest and most powerful armed forces of any corporation in the world, with their guards renowned worldwide and feared by many. Most firms will look to licensing from Arasaka corporate security guards, couriers, or mercenaries to protect their assets. However, Arasaka assets take priority if they are at risk and the troops themselves are loyal to death to the Japanese conglomerate.[2]
Arasaka has made a habit of buying up other companies worldwide, and bleeding out the competition of other Japanese corporations. They also give a heavy amount of support to Japanese communities all over the globe, despite their business practices and overall history being considered unethical.[6]
The Arasaka Corporation was founded in1915, bySasai Arasakain Chuo-ku,Tokyo,Japan. The company originally was focused on manufacturing and took full advantage ofWorld War IIto forward their wealth and power by supplying the Imperial Army. However Sasai foresaw thedefeat of Japanand worked to ensure his company and fortune would survive the war by spreading his wealth across the globe, out of the reach of the post-war leadership. Soon enough the Japanese surrendered and the country was in ruin, with most cities destroyed by the constant bombings (with the exception ofKyoto).[4]
On August 15th, 1945, the Emperor broadcast the edict of surrender and renounced his divinity.Saburo Arasaka, a former lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Navy and son of Sasai, was thunderstruck. He was on the verge ofseppukuin the compound's cherry tree grove of the hospital when he had a moment of epiphany and a vision. Right at that moment, Saburo saw the wisdom of his father's actions. As family scion, that fortune would soon be his to control, a fortune that, if wielded correctly, would permit a clever man to push Japan back towards a position of power from which it could dominate the world politically and economically. The children ofAmaterasuwould prevail, if not under theEmperor, then under another deity: commerce. Saburo drew the half inch of dagger that had penetrated his abdominal muscles before the vision had stayed his hand and returned to the household. That same night, he began to study politics, economics, and history, which continued until his father's death.
Although Japan's economy and industry were in ruins, Saburo studied all matters of business, economics, and politics while attendingTodai. This was to ensure he had the skills necessary to accomplish his goals. Sasai had capitalized on wartime industry, but against Saburo's impassioned urging, he had made sure that the bulk of the Arasaka fortune was covertly protected in concealed overseas assets and accounts.[6]
In 1960 Sasai Arasaka died and the 41 year old Saburo stepped into his late father's shoes as the head of the Arasaka Corporation. At the time Arasaka was still a relatively small company, having just reestablished itself in international commerce. Before his death, Saburo's father had been slowly retrieving the capital and resources kept secret during the war and after he died, Saburo himself continued the task.
In 1970 Saburo created the Arasaka Security division of the Arasaka Corporation. The new division specialized in high quality personal and corporate manpower, electronic, and computer security and protection.[6]Slowly, over 25 years, Arasaka Security developed a sterling reputation as the most potent company of its type in the world. In 1990, Arasaka emerged on the global 500 list and by the mid 1990s, Arasaka guards were employed by thousands of powerful individuals and corporations around the world and Arasaka intrusion countermeasures and computer security experts were retained by many others. It wasn't long thereafter that the Security division was one of Arasaka's three most powerful holdings, equaled only by the Arasaka Bank and Arasaka Manufacturing.
Saburo's dedication to his study enabled him to foresee the world marketcollapse of 1994and theUScollapse of 1996. Saburo was able to take the appropriate steps, and through his shrewd manipulation and investments, make the Arasaka Corporation one of the few commercial institutions to profit from the crash. Arasaka was big before the crash, but in the period afterwards it assumed gigantic stature, becoming one of the largestMegacorporationsin the world, now ranking at number two on the global 500 list.
At some point in the 1990s, the Arasaka European Group constructed theirEuropean headquartersin Paris,France.[4]
In 1997 Arasaka Security moved into paramilitary contracting and began training one of the world's first corporate armies at the corporation's guard and agentschooling facilityin the forbidden northern wastes ofHokkaido. An age of ruthlessness followed, with Arasaka destroying or absorbing as much of its competition as it could and buying out any non-competitive companies that Saburo thought would make a good asset.
Arasaka's control over thegovernment of Japanwas becoming problematic in the late 1990s. Saburo was close to having complete control with 60% of Japan's National Diet being Arasaka-bought politicians. However, due to growing fear amongst other Japanese corporations about Arasaka's government takeover attempt, a group was formed by large and small Japanese corporations that united underFACS(Far Asian Co-prosperity Sphere) banner. This countered Saburo's control of the government and many politicians were arrested. FACS would continue to undermine Arasaka's plans in the coming decades.[4]
The years from 1997 to 2020, however, had seen the Arasaka Corporation continue to diversify and strengthen. Its major functional arms were still the Arasaka Bank, Manufacturing, and Security groups. Although the corporation was astoundingly wealthy and powerful, and Saburo one of the wealthiest men in the world, he had not forgotten his original goal. During this time Saburo stepped down as CEO and, in his place, his sonKei Arasakabecame the nominal head of the Arasaka Corporation. However all major decisions and policies were still subject to Saburo's discretion. Saburo had groomed his son for eventual complete control, and the realization of his personal goals.[6]
During the early 2000s, Arasaka contracted major bodyguard services toSlovakia. Though while not having much political power as other Japanese or Korean corporations within the nation, Arasaka still maintained subsidiaries producing articles for the European market.[8]
In 2008, theTaiwanese Governmenthired Arasaka to plan out their defense force in fear of a Chinese invasion. Taiwan managed anti-ship, plane, and missile defenses on the Kinmen and Matsu islands, and Hsinchu, Chanhua, as well as Anping. These islands all contained contracted Arasaka troops for constant hourly monitoring of the Communist and Chinese sponsoredMilitech.[9]
In 2010, Arasaka alongsideWNS,EBM, andWorldSat, as well asTriadforces, repelled the invasion of the MLC onHong Kong. After three years, they were successful in repelling the invasion of Hong Kong, and all four corporations took control of sections of the city.[4]Arasaka secured Chai Wan and Shau Kei Wan, with corporate housing on the mid-levels of the peak and offices on the Bay. They also had their new regional office constructed on the new set of land.[9]
In 2013, Arasaka America faced major terrorist attacks on itsheadquartersinNight City. A rockerboy namedJohnny Silverhandled a riot at the base of the Tower and managed to murder multiple Arasaka employees as well as the CEO of the American branch,Toshiro.
During this time, Arasaka partnered withSony Corporationin co-producing theMedusa 2000. The weapon gave the user direct interface to a powerful multi-medium zoom lens with image enhancers, telescopic, macro-zoom abilities, anti-dazzle, UV, and thermograph sensors. Any data filmed was stored into data chips or directly into a neural processor storage bank.
In 2020, Arasaka secured a political seat in the government ofPortugal. The controlling cooperative alliance had broken in two factions. The cooperative party (The Consensual Progress Party) had two candidates to the presidency, each of them supported by three of the controlling corps (Iberian Agrolndustrial, Amazonian Security, andWNSagainst Merchant, Arasaka, and Oliveira-Leisure). Tensions between Amazonian Security and Arasaka had risen in attempts to restore harmony and a stable economic growth to the country.[8]
Sometime during 2020, an Arasaka Cargo Submarine and its crew including Captain Hyung Mitsumoto sunk in the North Pacific. This led to the acquisition of IDA (International Defense Alliance), an independent organization that was then put under the Arasaka subsidiary, Sato Commercial Shipping. A covert IDA team was dispatched to the Bonin trench to bring the sub to the surface.
In 2021 an oceanic corporation known as Internationale Handelsmarine Aktiengesellschaft,IHAG, announced bankruptcy. BothCINOandOTECwere looking to acquire the stock in the corporation, but each company was too closely matched in buying power for either to get an edge. So they decided to whittle down their opponent's resources and sabotage their attempts at stock acquisition.[5]However, this proved ineffective by itself so the Aquacorp of CINO hired on Arasaka, while OTEC hiredMilitech. Being the two largest paramilitary corporations in the world, both Arasaka and Militech had been rivaling for many years on different contractors. Arasaka saw this as an opportunity to then whittle Militech's resources.
During this timeSaburo Arasakasoon came to considerDonald Lundeea real threat, someone who threatened his goal for the Arasaka Corporation. In 2022,Kei Arasakawas responsible for a great deal of the daily operations and important decisions during theIHAGmess. While he viewed the fight like any other business operation, and would never take it personally, in alignment with Arasaka tradition he intended to stop at nothing to make sure his side was victorious and would never step down from a direct offense to Arasaka. Kei also had full control over his father's corporation as, during this time, Saburo was in seclusion for security reasons for the duration of the conflict. However, he knew the war wasn't going to end well and began to work directly withGeneral Ubo Tanaka, readying himself to sacrifice major assets in order to win. The only thing left was his contingency plans that he hoped would save the zaibatsu if the worst occurred and Arasaka lost.
The end of the war for the company saw the death of Kei Arasaka and thedestructionof theArasaka TowersinNight Cityin 2023, as it was destroyed with a mini-nuke by a Militech operative team.President Kressblamed the Night City bombing on Arasaka, despite the fault lying with Militech, and further demonized Arasaka for her own interests. Arasaka's charters to operate in theUnited Stateswere immediately revoked, its members and board declared terrorists, and its assets either seized or driven off-shore. Arasaka's participation in the Fourth Corporate War almost led to Japanese government breakdown. By repudiating Arasaka after the official end of the war in 2025, Japan's national face was saved and Arasaka was reduced to a Japan-only corporation for the next decade.[2]
Even after the defeat in the Fourth Corporate War, Arasaka maintained one of the largest armed forces of any other corporation. The corporation had most of its operations limited toJapanand heavily reduced. Despite the situation, Arasaka still managed to hold onto a majority of their assets.[2]By 2040, the Arasaka Corporation rebuilt itself and was slowly gaining back much of its prior strength. The corporation was also attempting to amend its relations with the NUSA and being welcomed back to continue its operations. Arasaka still had small operations in select parts of the NUSA but nothing official. Arasaka still covertly licensed their troops to other firms worldwide but they would have to use the uniforms of their new "employers." The Arasaka Corporation's goal had also not changed: they wanted to return to the political and economic height it held in the 2020s.[2]
Arasaka may have been under the nominal control ofSaburo Arasaka, but for many years there stood factions vying for dominance. As of 2045, there were three major factions struggling to come out on top. Each one hoping their family patriarch, Saburo, would eventually hand the reigns over to them. The Arasaka Factions of 2045 were as follows:
Several smaller factions also existed within the corporation but they did not hold as much power as the main three: Kiji, Taka, and Hato. Arasaka's world influence was still present as it remained at the top after the rebuild era.
In 2067, theEmperorofJapanwas saved after an attempted assassination by an Arasaka bodyguard who intercepted the assassin's bullet.
In 2068, Arasaka collaborated with theYaiba Corporationand designed the fastest and most expensive motorcycle on the market, theKusanagi CT-3X. The Kusanagi became a favorite among gangers,bosozokus, and celebrities around the world.[3]
During theUnification War, 2069 to 2070, between theNUSAand theFree States, Arasaka supported Night City, regaining its favor and eventually returning to the city in 2070 at the request of then-city councilmanLucius Rhyne.[5]Arasaka arrived in Coronado Bay with their super carrier as the NUSA troops were ready for the invasion of the city, the troops were ordered to retreat in fear of the already unstable NUSA collapsing due to another conflict. The Arasaka Corporation was once again welcomed into the Americas as they rebuilt their American headquarters inNight City.[10]Arasaka now after reclaiming much of its former strength, had fully reclaimed its position in Night City.[11]They started with establishing theArasaka Waterfront, bringing down its competition in the area. Arasaka razed the crumbling structures ofold Watson, a vast walled complex defended by guards and automated turrets. These became container warehouses, hangars, and autonomous assembly lines. The goal was to get a successful port and supply chain for the city and theFree States.[citation needed]
In the early 2070s, a bioengineer namedAnders Hellmanwas appointed the director of theRelic Project. Using theSoulkiller's source code, Hellman created a new piece of technology that was capable of communicating with personality constructs. Because of his continued work, loyalty, and personal relationship with the Arasaka family - Saburo considered offering him a position of Director of theKyotoInstitute of Technology.
In 2071, the Arasaka security forces prevented mass riots acrossSan Francisco, managing to quell the conflict.
In 2074, inBrazil, an Arasaka investigation destroyed a terrorist cell that was taking place inRio de Janeiro. The Arasaka soldiers executed all terrorists responsible and ended a series of attacks the country had been facing.
In 2076, the Arasaka counterintelligence department managed to secure a corporate summit in Jakarta, Indonesia, stopping 45 plots to attack and sabotage the summit.[3]
In 2077, a Militech operatives team discovered that Arasaka had been hiding the fact that they had amass driveron theMoon. TheESAwas the only organization allowed to operate and own mass drivers, an edge they wanted to keep, because of this Militech tipped off the ESA council in order to affect Arasaka. The ESA called an intimidate meeting to reexamine Arasaka's license in space affairs. The ones responsible for the mistake were Arasaka America, of the Night City operatives branch, many employees feared Japan's response. In an attempt to cover their tracksArthur Jenkinsordered a flatline of members of the council, a move that, among other decisions, cost him his life.[3]
InJapan, Arasaka engineers successfully conducted ballistic missile tests on Yakushima. The new electromagnetic missile was to combat the growing terrorist threat as well as other rogue elements that threaten public safety. Rumors also circulated of Arasaka developing a new line of reflex boosters that would last twice as long as the current models on the market. The corporation was also looking for willing participates for the experiments.
During a shareholders report, it was announced by the board of directors that Lasombra, Arasaka HQ inMexico, increased shareholder voting power by 1.5%.
In Night City, Arasaka was voted the number #1 Megacorporation to work for. TheJapanesezaibatsu juggernaut would give employees the latest in cyberware technology with a loyalty obligation of only 20 years.[12]
InTokyo, Arasaka introduced a revolutionary new line of premium biochip called theRelic, which was advertised as a means for buyers to preserve a copy of their personalities for future generations to interact with. It was first reported byNippon Daily, not long after Arasaka officially confirmed it. The revolutionary new tech was said to be very expensive and would be a service exclusively for the 1% who could be able to afford it, this meant that the product would not be made available to the general public within the foreseeable future.
Arasaka had announced it had signed a cooperation agreement withNight City University, offering its professors and studentsArasaka Ozukumi Sxcognitive implants on loan at a 20% discounted rate.
Saburocontinued serving as Arasaka's CEO up until his death, when he was murdered byYorinobu. The death of the CEO was covered up and attributed to poisoning, while Yorinobu consolidated the corporation's support and became the new CEO. Some within the corporation viewed Yorinobu's sudden ascension with suspicion, and considered backingHanako.[3]
Yorinobu made controversial decisions within the company such as selling assets of facilities inFukuokaandKitakyushu. The Arasaka Corporation's stock jumped up by 3% after the decision was made. Arasaka sponsored the Dashi Parade, a classical Japanese festival withinJapantown,Night City. The parade would also become the festival in remembering of Saburo Arasaka, one that Hanako would attend prior to the news of her fathers passing. During this time tensions were rising between Arasaka andMilitech, corporate sabotage could be what was possibly leading to another Corporate War between the two corporations.
After successfully rescuing his sister Hanako, Yorinobu called an emergency meeting the Arasaka supervisor board in Night City. Top executives fromTokyo, as well as branch directors fromParis,Shanghai, and Kinshasa all to meet in theArasaka Towerof the American Division headquarters. Yorinobu had a plan for a military coup that would give him and those loyal to his faction complete control of Arasaka Corporation for his plan of sabotage.

The Arasaka Corporation is a highly diversified corporation, however only one of its branches is much more ubiquitously visible than the others, especially in theEECandNUSA: the Arasaka Security division. Arasaka is famous for their black clad guards that are employed by many of the powerful people and corporations in the world. Even if the guards are not present, the Arasaka logo appears prominently on many weapons, computers, and other security equipment routinely used by the security teams of many organizations and companies. Arasaka is the world's most obvious force for private and corporate security contracting. It is common knowledge that Arasaka Security is the best way to protect a person's assets or themselves, Arasaka contracts and rents its security services in various ways.[13]
Arasaka is not the only company that offers this service, but it is the largest and most reputable. Arasaka's security personnel are known to be the best trained and best equipped then any other service. They are not cheap, but the investment is generally considered profitable. Arasaka can provide groups of one to one thousand agents per contract. The service is twenty-four hours a day, and the guards can be accommodated, at the discretion of the contractors, privately, on site or in the local offices of Arasaka. All Arasaka guards are fully trained in security procedures, equipment handling, and urban combat, armed and unarmed, at close range. Depending on how much the contractor wants to pay for each guard, there are various levels of weaponry and specialization available, from unarmed counter guards to fully armed and armored rapid response combat gear.
There are a number of options available on any manpower contracting at varying expense. The client can order all-male or all-female guards, or a specific ratio of sexes, or as Arasaka contracts its services around the world, clients can order guards fluent in Japanese, German, Spanish, English, Italian, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Korean and French. All guards are required to be conversant, although not fluent, in Japanese and English. Bilingual guards are also always available. Guards specializing in heavy weapons, unarmed combat, and specialized terrain are available for contracts that call for varied situations. Different levels of security force concealment can also be ordered, from completely discreet and invisible to ostentatiously threatening. If the security forces are visible, clients can choose to have them be unidentified or clearly identified as Arasaka Troops. Only in rare circumstances, such as when a little misdirection is called for, will Arasaka troops actually wear the uniform or logo of the contracting corporation, or a third party. Arasaka also contracts out its paramilitary forces for one shot operations, such as extractions. This type of contract can be extremely costly, due to the loss of expensive men and equipment.
Another type of protection that Arasaka provides is personal security in the form of bodyguards, escort teams and household security. The service is expensive, but popular among celebrities, wealthy businessmen, and the politicians of several nations who no longer trust their respective Secret Service agencies. As with corporate guards, there are several options, including gender, number of guards, dress style, age, visibility, race, nationality, level of armament, training and services performed. It is considered very chic in some circles to have one good looking, full-time Arasaka bodyguard of the opposite gender on one's payroll. These single bodyguards usually work solo or manage other non-Arasaka personnel retained by their client.
In addition to supplying trained men and women to corporations, groups and individuals, Arasaka also leases and sells the security equipment that it manufactures. Typical items include cameras, perimeter detection and surveillance equipment, computerized security offices and networks, fire extinguishing systems, security turrets, robotic personnel, and computerized personnel access systems. Also available are more exotic items such as weapons and bomb detecting equipment, booby traps and other "lethal deterrence systems". Computer security is another product available from Arasaka. Proprietary Arasaka ICE systems, white and black, are also available for installation into client's computer systems. Arasaka will train non-Arasaka personnel in the operations of all of the security systems that it sells, but it's more typical for clients to buy a package that includes both the equipment and Arasaka-trained people to run it.
The last type of personnel that Arasaka contracts out are security consultants. If someone wants good security run by inhouse people, but lacks the expertise, an option to hire a team of Arasaka Security Consultants to inspect facilities, and do an analysis of the capabilities of potential enemies. The consultants will use that information to make a recommendation on the type and strength of the security forces someone should maintain, and the kinds of equipment and countermeasures needed to install. Consultants will operate on any scale, from personal bodyguarding to worldwide corporate protection.
A sub-division of its Security Division, Arasaka runs an extensive police contracting service. Police services are similar in many respects to security services, but the personnel receive slightly different training and equipment. The clients are cities and counties rather than corporations. As they are required to work with the public, Arasaka police officers are much more prone to have good interpersonal skills than their dour counterparts who work in private security. Most weapons and equipment are the same, but Arasaka managed police departments will have police-fitted cars and vans at their disposal and, for most situations, will be more inclined to use these than the heavy riot vehicles favored by the security departments.
Arasaka police, much like any corporate police, are required to work within the limits of civil and federal laws with regards to police procedures and ethics. Of course, as is always the case with corporate operations, they are more likely to circumvent these standards for convenience than public police departments. Countless towns, counties, arcologies, and cities around the world rely on private police forces. Among those serviced by Arasaka are San Diego, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Honolulu, Bucharest (Romania), Belfast (Ireland), andSingapore; as well as several major Japanese cities includingFukuoka, Hiroshima,Nagoya,Yokohama, andSapporo.Tokyo, interestingly enough, is still using a public police department despite Arasaka pressure.
Arasaka, however, does not always require payment for maintaining a police force in a city. Arasaka may take non-monetary compensation, including a hand in local policy making, land and real estate, or shipping and free port rights, or it may reap other advantages such as complete police and security control of an area near sensitive corporate facilities or an advantage over competitors who have offices in the same area. Examples of this can be seen in the Arasaka factories in Yokohama, which are protected by Arasaka Security and a municipal police force run by Arasaka.
The weapons manufacturing division of Arasaka was the original intent of the company when it was founded bySasai Arasakain 1915. During the 1930s and 1940s the company took full advantage of the war and was heavily involved in the heavy industry side of things, manufacturing ships and planes for theImperial Japanese Navy. After the defeat of Japan in 1945, the post war industrial sector was in shambles and it was only tillSaburotook over in the 1960s the industrial manufacturing division picked back up. The corporation kept its Heavy Industry sector while also moving into manufacturing equipment for its own forces which fit into categories; light arms, computers, armor and small vehicles.
Within the theGreater Tokyo Metropolitanarea, Arasaka has one of its largestmanufacturing facilitieslocated in Yokohama, used to supply their force with weapons. Arasaka produces all of the infantry weapons used by its troops and by its clients. In 2022 they began producing heavy weapons and exotics. Most of Arasaka's weapons production runs to small arms, tasers, EMP guns, automated guns, smart guns, melee katanas/tantos, and anti-personnel mines. They also manufacture a line of body armor and an assortment of very popular vehicles. Although their weapon sales are nowhere near that of theMilitech Corporation, Arasaka's sales are brisk and their weapons are some of the most sought after from governments and corporations alike.
Arasaka Manufacturing advertises in a fashion similar to the security arm: in periodicals and information nets tailored to specific target clienteles. Weapons systems are promoted in police periodicals and military journals and security equipment is advertised in electronics magazines, corporate journals, and publications serving wealthy individuals. As with the security services, multi-media presentations and chips are available detailing the advantages of all Arasaka manufactured systems. No sensitive or proprietary information is included with the presentations or chips.
Arasaka doesn't usually interfere with the individual marketing tactics of its smaller subsidiary companies, but it does monitor promotions and advertising campaigns to make sure that they fall within the broad guidelines established by the corporation.
The Arasaka Corporation has a large line up of cyberware products that can be bought worldwide. Arasaka is one of the largest manufacturers of cyberware, and have a variety of lethal cyberware more common with Solos and mercs as well as non-lethal cyberware that can be seen on everyday citizens worldwide. Arasaka branded cyberware is frequently seen with millions of people opting to the efficiency and reliability of the Japanese manufacturing giant.Johnny Silverhand, legendaryrockerboyand terrorist, whose signature cyberarm was a product of Arasaka. Other very common products of cyberware are items such as theMantis BladesorGorilla Arms. Arasaka also deals in leg cyberware allowing users to replace the entire bottom half of their body. Full body conversions are all along the Arasaka cyberware services, one of their more famous customersAdam Smashertakes advantage of this division. Netrunner gear is also a specialty of the corporation with a variety of products commonly found in the market.
After the 1994 collapse, Arasaka set its sights on general manufacturing, buying out many smaller companies and their excess raw materials at a fraction of the cost. These failing business were turned around and became incredibly profitable for Arasaka, producing items from Airliners, to medical equipment and even children's toys. While part of Arasaka itself, they retained their original names and brands to not be associated with the more corporate and militaristic image of Arasaka. Arasaka General Manufacturing produces a host of consumer goods from spaceplanes, four different automobiles, pharmaceuticals, various lines of clothing, computer video games, prepackaged meals, phones, and office equipment.
The last core section and pillar of the Arasaka Corporation is the Arasaka Bank. The Bank is not widely visible to the public because it tends to deal exclusively with corporate and business accounts. The Arasaka Bank was established by Saburo, with help from his government contacts, in order to exploit the Japanese economic growth boom that he was predicting for the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The bank used a portion of the sizable Arasaka fortune in order to establish a capital base. Then, starting small and working up, it began taking corporate accounts, and, under the genius of Saburo's guidance, making high quality loans and investments with corporations destined for growth and expansion.
Under Saburo's expert touch, the Bank has turned a steady profit since its inception. Saburo's choice of loans and investments allowed the bank to remain on an even footing, even during the early nineties when several Japanese financial institutions were on shaky ground. There was a tight period during and after the '94 crash when several supposedly choice loans and investments went bad, but a little foresight enabled the Arasaka Bank to survive with minimal financial damage while many other institutions went bankrupt. Adroit management in the post-crash market kept the Bank turning a profit through those tough years.
The Arasaka Bank continues to do good business. Saburo was one of the first people to invest heavily in the cybernetic and Net related industries, and the returns from those transactions have padded the Arasaka accounts quite well. The Bank continues to deal primarily with corporate accounts, loans and investments, but it does handle some personal accounts, including those of the Arasaka family and several wealthy businessmen, celebrities and politicians from around the world. So far, business shows no sign of slacking.
The Arasaka Corporation has definitive rules and policies guiding corporate dress, uniforms and equipment. There is little freedom for variation except in the uppermost echelons of the corporation, and amongst bodyguards and undercover operatives. Employees of subsidiaries owned by Arasaka but not bearing the Arasaka name are not required to conform to the same standards as employees of Arasaka itself. Except for thefamily compound, where all the security is personally chosen by Saburo Arasaka such as:Shintaro Takayama,Katsuo Iwashima, orGoro Takemura. Arasaka guards, soldiers, and agents can be any race, nationality, or gender.
For corporate executives and staff the watchword is conservative. Expensive is permissible, but ostentatious is frowned upon. Arasaka defers to the styles of the times, but only within the borders of what the home office considers tasteful. Men and women may wear suits and ties, preferably with dark colors. Women may wear skirts and dresses, but sexually provocative attire is tolerated only in the lowest echelons of the corporation, and then only to a certain extent. There are exceptions for special circumstances. Corporate officers, both male and female, are expected to dress in a manner befitting their position. Although it is not required, most executives wear a silver Arasaka logo pin on the left lapel, and those executives who used to be soldiers wear a silver chrysanthemum pin with the Arasaka logo superimposed. Most visible cyberware is considered acceptable unless it covers the face.
All white collar Arasaka employees receive an Arasaka company accountTrauma Teamcard as part of their benefits. When off the job and away from company infirmaries they are required to keep this card on them at all times. Arasaka also manufactures its own portable computers and weapons, and it is considered poor taste to use non-Arasaka equipment when company-made products are available.
Guards are the most visible manifestation of the Arasaka Corporation. Consequently, Arasaka usually makes sure that their guards are immediately recognizable. Guard uniforms and equipment vary depending on the assignment, but the typical non-undercover Arasaka guard wears the black uniform considered so ubiquitous in the corporate world. This consists of black boots and gloves, a black jumpsuit, a black armor vest and a black cap with the Arasaka logo in silver. The guard's rank appears on the left arm and right collar wing, and the Arasaka logo on the right arm and left collar wing.
The basic uniform for the Arasaka soldier is similar to the guard outfit, but soldiers wear their names on their uniform breasts and have a chrysanthemum logo above their rank markings. In combat, soldiers also wear more extensive body armor than the standard guards, including visor helmets, armor on the torso and arms, and special trousers. All Arasaka soldiers are promoted from the guards.
Arasaka bodyguards either dress in black or white suits, however if the client requires it they can carry whatever equipment the client is willing to provide or lease from Arasaka. This leads to tremendous variation as Arasaka provides bodyguard services for all sorts, from heads of state to rock stars. Almost all Arasaka bodyguards, male and female, are distinguished ex-soldiers.
Arasaka special agents can requisition whatever uniforms, resources and equipment they deem necessary to accomplish their mission. This equipment is usually not traceable to Arasaka. Arasaka maintains a large stock of weapons and equipment manufactured by other companies and purchased by dummy organizations for use by special agents and strike teams in black operations. As with bodyguards, most special agents are former soldiers who have distinguished themselves and been promoted and retrained.
Arasaka service employees use a uniform consisting of a baggy white jumpsuit and cap with white accessories. This is the same for all types of service employees. The only way one can tell the difference between maintenance, custodial, messenger and other service level employees is by the color and shape of the logos on their shoulders and caps, their I.D. badges, and the equipment they carry. In Japanese office buildings service employees show deference by bowing in the presence of executives. Failure to comply with this protocol can result in dismissal. This rule is not applied in Arasaka offices outside ofJapan.
The Arasaka Corporation functions as any corporation would, despite the original intent ofSaburo Arasakaor any Arasaka family members. In order to do this it has to consistently sell its services to the professional community. All of Arasaka's advertising is designed and managed in-house by special departments, tailored to individual nations and regions, and run from offices in the towers. TheTokyo officehandles international advertising and public relations. The Arasaka Corporation sponsors a variety of events, festivals, companies, braindances, anime, media personnel, stores, hotels, and many more. There are more discreet tactics for marketing the three core branches of the corporation.
Arasaka's most profitable and widespread division is its Security branch. The Security Branch was also Saburo Arasaka's most effective tool. Consequently, most marketing efforts are concentrated on selling security services and contracts. The key factor in marketing those security services is Arasaka's enduring reputation for excellence.
Arasaka Bank advertises only within corporate publications. Their services are exclusive enough to not require extensive publicity. Information on financial services can only be obtained by appointment with the corporation, and no information is open to the public. Generally, Arasaka Bank directly contacts the people and organizations with which it wants to do business.
Arasaka Manufactures is advertised in a manner similar to the security branch: in publications and information networks suitable for the specific customers desired. Weapons systems are advertised in police publications and in the military press, and the security team is advertised in electronic journals, corporate journals, and publications aimed at wealthy individuals. Like security services, multimedia presentations and chips are available detailing the advantages of equipment manufactured by Arasaka. No sensitive or restricted information is included in these materials.
Arasaka is one of the largest and richest corporations in the world. Its various holdings and properties span the globe. The board of directors has access to funds and resources that make those in many small countries pale. Matched with these resources is power in its most impressive form. Arasaka, like all corporations, is one of the few organizations capable of imposing its will on the world, filling the void left by the collapsed national governments.
The total value of Arasaka's properties in 2020 was roughly¥9.5 Trillion,€$475 Billion. Together with two or three other large corporations, Arasaka is approaching the barrier of half a billion Eb. Of those €$475 billion, €$175 billion is from Arasaka Bank. Most of the bank's assets consist of corporate and government debt for loans. €$200 billion represent the value, accounts and liquid and solid assets of the security and manufacturing branches. The remaining €$100 billion represent the value of Arasaka-owned subsidiary corporations, secret fund reserves and the personal fortune of 10,000 million euros fromSaburo Arasakaand the family. By 2077, the corporation doubled its value to €$890 Billion across all its total properties.
Arasaka is a public corporation and has 560 million shares of common capital on the World Stock Exchange. Actually, the Arasaka family controls 54% of the company's titles. Another 15% is held by the board of directors located inTokyo, Paris,Shanghai, and Kinshasa. The board is made up of Saburo's nineteen most trusted allies (Keihad held the twentieth seat in 2020, but was replaced withHanako). Saburo, as the main shareholder, is the chairman of the board. Hanako Arasaka is also a nominal shareholder.
The remaining 31% of Arasaka's shares are traded openly in the market. Arasaka's shares are consistently strong and are considered a reliable investment. The value has fluctuated between 100 and 140 euros in the world stock market. Since 31% is an important part of capital, the corporation carefully monitors large acquisitions. If someone who does not like Arasaka seems to be trying to amass a portfolio of shares large enough to reach a position of power on the board, a black operations team is sent to "retire" the suspect. Sometimes a wealthy person or other corporation manages to amass enough actions to exercise considerable power in the voting of Arasaka shareholders and sometimes these people vote against the board. This is tolerated for reasons of image. However, when these shareholders become too noisy in the voting, and protest the exclusivity of the board and its goals, they are "convinced" by a black operations team to deviate from Arasaka's interests.
Arasaka, not counting its subsidiaries, owns 250 Osprey V-type aircraft and more than 250 AV-4. A quarter of each type of these vehicles is used by the corporate offices. Three quarters belong to the Arasaka guards and the military forces. Naturally there are some exchanges, but military versions usually have combat options and camouflage schemes and are less luxurious than their corporate counterparts. The corporation also owns twenty C-25 heavy cargo planes, which can carry skydivers, heavy equipment and cross intercontinental distances. Arasaka-owned airplanes include several small executive reactors and helicopters. They are unarmed, but they are fast and luxurious. The reactors have intercontinental capacity, strictly local helicopters.
The air transport capacity provided by the C-25s is complemented by the three Arasaka container ships. Sato Commercial Shipping, a subsidiary of Yokohama, owns other large ships, such as container ships, cisterns and submarine freighters. This gives Arasaka a considerable capacity for maritime displacement.
The military forces and the Arasaka guards possess a certain number of vehicles produced in house. More than 2,000 Riot 8 and Combat 10 are in use worldwide, and countless thousands of Kumas and modified Lexus cars. Another 2,500 of each of the combat vehicles are distributed throughout the warehouses ofJapan,EuropeandAmerica. These units await to be sent to customers but can be activated for combat in a short period of time. Arasaka uses non-Arasaka manufactured vehicles from many other corporations such asZetatech,Militech,Chevillon,Villefort, andRayfield.
In addition to all this usual material, Arasaka has a reserve of other equipment too diverse and numerous to catalog. Various heavy military weapons, light weapons and equipment, specialized airplanes and land vehicles, ship fleets, including the supercarrierKujira, supercomputers and linear frames are included.
Arasaka and its subsidiaries during the majority of it's life from 2013 to 2045 employed more than one million people around the world. Three quarters are executives, researchers, counter intelligence, and various workers, both office and factory, from Arasaka and its many sub-corporations. The rest are troops of one kind or another, including guards, soldiers and agents. The troops are divided more or less as follows: 100,000 are Arasaka soldiers and special forces combat teams, 200,000 are guards for industrial contracting, bodyguards and advisers and 5000 are undercover agents, assassins and spies.
Arasaka has a secret resource that is more powerful than all its obvious forces: its secret influence on powerful people and corporations around the world. Unfortunately, the details of this particular resource are too intricate, extensive and unknown to the general public. The banking division of Arasaka was another brainchild of Saburo Arasaka, it was founded shortly after his takeover in the 1960's and he used his various government contacts to get if off the ground. He used a considerable sum of the family wealth as a capital base and started making loans and investments with other corporations. Saburo personally invested heavily in theCyberneticsandNetrelated industries, making a considerable return on investment and padding the bank accounts of Arasaka quite well.
Arasaka has more subsidiaries than almost any other corporation in the world. Arasaka's subsidiaries, like those of most large corporations, are connected through a complex network of cross-linked owners, loans and investments, commercial and financial ties and co-addresses. Arasaka Security, Arasaka Bank and Arasaka Manufactures are the central companies, all under the aegis of the Arasaka corporation. Despite the system of cross-linked owners, Arasaka is not a keiretsu. In a keiretsu there is no large concentration of power in any branch. In Arasaka, the entire corporation responds directly to the board of directors of the Arasaka Corporation and the main companies.
A few of the hundreds of subsidiaries of the Arasaka Corporation include: Arasaka Security, Arasaka Bank, Arasaka Manufactures, Arasaka International, Arasaka America, Arasaka European Group, Arasaka Police Services, Arasaka Chemistry, Sato Commercial Ship, Kanshiro MicroElectric, Barrett Engineering-Arasaka, Nagoya Transportation, Japan Airlines (JAL), Korusu Commercial Aircraft, Kyoran-MediaStorm Entertainment, Lubcheck Structural Materials, Pan-Ground Communications, Glaser Model Agency, Pharmaceutical Ito, All-American Pictures, Krieger Beer, Scandia Aerospace, Matsura Food Products, Children's Kingdom Toy Stores, Tokyo/Miami/Los Angeles Adventure Land Amusement Parks, and Tender-Love Baby Care Products.
The major Arasaka towers are impressive places, projecting a large part of the corporation's public face. The larger the corporation, the more their offices and towers become a beacon of wealth and image. In keeping with Arasaka's monumental size and reputation, their towers are not only widespread, appearing in major cities across the globe, but standardized so they are instantly recognizable. The special facilities, such as training camps and factories, don't follow the strict image guidelines applied to the towers as they are less visible to the public. Major Arasaka Towers can be found inTokyo, Taipai,Hong Kong,Shanghai,Seoul, Bangkok, Baghdad,Sydney, London, Hamburg, Paris, Madrid, Bratislava, Rome, Geneva, Stockholm, Helsinki, The Hague, Dubai, Kinshasa, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Montreal,Night City, Nairobi and Moscow. Smaller offices exist in almost all major cities. InJapanalmost every major city will have an Arasaka office;Osaka,Kyoto,Sapporo,Kitakyushu,Narita, andFukuoka. TheNUSAis home to some of the most regional offices outside of Japan;Washington, D.C.,New York City,Los Angeles, San Francisco,Chicago, and Honolulu.
A tower contains the top Arasaka officials for any given region, including the National Directors and Regional Vice Presidents. Beneath the Regional VP will be the Regional Security Director, Regional Sales Director, and Regional Bank Director. Chain of command for the individual departments proceeds downwards from Region to Area, Local, District, and Site. The Tokyo tower has the offices for the corporation President, executive vice presidents, board of directors, and other top officials. All large offices also have R&D departments for developers either not cleared for the Honshu R&D facility, or who need to work in a specific area of the world for one reason or another.
Guards and soldiers are quartered and trained at specialized facilities around the world and throughout Arasaka served countries. Sizable contingents are always billeted and maintained at major towers for purposes of on-site security, quick response and firefighting. An Arasaka tower should have between one and two hundred guards and fifty and one hundred soldiers billeted on site at any given time, although not all of those will be on duty or available. Larger contingents of guards and troops intended for client rotation are maintained in barracks located outside of major cities. Most of the soldiers and guards available will be typical contract types, but some will be elite solos.
Security at Arasaka towers is, of course, rigid. Quads of armed guards and soldiers patrol twenty-four hours a day. Sensitive installations are under 24 hour manned protection. Special response teams are on call at all times, prepared to scramble in defense of the tower or any Arasaka client requesting aid. Redundant security systems monitor computers, access, and traffic control.Netrunnersare on duty at all times, scanning for intrusion from the Net. Air defense systems under computer and human control can be activated at a moment's notice. Special security centers deep in the subterranean areas of each tower monitor and coordinate the individual security systems and teams.
Public relations have been problematic for Arasaka Corporation since the early 2000s. The corporation suffers under an image of brooding, ominous power. The Arasaka board of directors has attempted to cast the best light possible on itself, extolling the virtues of its security department, touting the philanthropic work of the bank, explaining how its manufacturing arm and subsidiaries, and sponsoring many festivals or expos that are the backbone of an economically sound inJapan. Though there is truth to this, it has not helped much to overcome the dark images associated with the corporation. Even with people who largely respect Arasaka, there is always an undercurrent of fear tempering their attitude towards the corporation.
Opinion on Arasaka around the world also varies. In Japan and various Asian nations, Arasaka can be seen in a more positive light, often helping in the reconstruction or protection of various nations. Opinion in Japan is split, with many believing Arasaka to be a menace and others believing the corporation to be beneficial. Places such asTaiwan,Hong Kong,Singapore, orAustraliagenerally have a more positive view of the corporation. In theNUSA, the country's opinion on Arasaka is split, between people who view the corporation positively, being one of the few that aided the country after the government failed to support them, and others believing Arasaka further ushered the corporate colonialism that currently plagued the planet. However, after theFourth Corporate War, and withPresident Kressblaming theNight City bombingon the Arasaka Corporation, more Americans saw the company as the enemy, though others resisted such notions due to Militech's backing of President Kress.
When the corporation gets wind of someone sniffing around in the wrong place, or when someone finds out something they shouldn't, the local Arasaka office will arrange for them to have an accident. If it is a particularly sensitive mission the home office inTokyowill be contacted to prep a special operation to deal with the problem. By and large, most local offices are more than adequately equipped and staffed to handle such tasks. In the past reporters have attempted to write an autobiography ofHanako Arasakawithout the consent of the family, Saburo took great offense to this and had the reporter eliminated
Typically, great pains will be taken to see that a black operation is not connected with Arasaka unless the corporation wants to make an example of the target. There are, however, times when Arasaka goes out of its way to advertise its involvement in an operation. This is usually when it is retaliating against some person, group or other corporation that has publicly infringed against it. Arasaka also has a policy of visibly assassinating individuals and assaulting corporations that breach security at installations protected by Arasaka contracts. In these situations Arasaka is powerful and ruthless, maintaining its reputation as a persistent and deadly adversary.
Arasaka's black ops and political and financial influence had come of age in the world of 2020, giving the corporation far reaching influence across the world. Hundreds of influential politicians and agents at all levels of government and in every important country in the world are in Arasaka's pocket. Thousands of influential and wealthy private citizens, police departments and corporate executives are also under Arasaka's control. Arasaka already has more financial power in the industrialized world than any other single corporation. If it weren't for other corporate alliances arrayed against it, it might have been the single most powerful factor onEarth.
The highest priority for Arasaka employees is loyalty. This is especially true in the Security arm, where most of the sensitive operations are handled. Arasaka Security agents will lay their lives on the line for the corporation first and the client second. Troops are required to demonstrate unquestioning obedience when they are dispatched on missions, although they must use initiative and intelligence on assignment or in action. Agents and executives who show signs of wavering loyalty, or fail badly in their assignments are dismissed. Those who betray the company, or cause it damage are eliminated.
The Arasaka Corporation has many enemies around the world. These enemies range from; corporations that compete directly with the company or have clashed with it, powerful individuals who suspect that their blackmailers have some relation to Arasaka, and even law enforcement officers from all over the world who suspect the extent of the illegal operations of Arasaka.
Among the corporations Arasaka has dealt with in the past areInfoComp, which had studied Arasaka's history and holdings multiple times for its database,Network News 54, which has lost several reporters investigating scandals related to Arasaka, and finallyMilitech. InfoComp is tiny compared to Arasaka, and receives little attention. Arasaka avoids direct confrontations with NN54, however the corporation will often report bad press for the corporation while praising its competitor. Militech and Arasaka have been in conflict on several occasions, and continue to face each other on a regular basis. Tensions between the two corporations through mutual sabotage have led to a Corporate War in the 2020s. Law enforcement agencies are contained not only by eliminating their agents, but by the skill with which Arasaka conceals its conflicts of interest and illegal operations.
Within the homeland of the corporation,Japan, Arasaka has also had problems with various corporations that try and undermine its operations. Many Japanese corporations formed a union specifically designed to counter Arasaka, known asFACS. The union has fought against Arasaka by exposing its corruption within the country. Another corporation from the East wasKang Tao, which made efforts to steal information, technology, and various corporate employees bought out from Arasaka to forward their own success.
WithinEEC, Arasaka generally has conflict with the European council on occasion. However most of its operations were stable. In the late 2020s, tensions rose between Arasaka and a European corporation known as Amazonian Security.
Allies with Arasaka can be as grand as its enemies. Since the early 2000s, Arasaka has held a good relationship withWorld News Serviceoften the two participating in conflicts as allies. WNS is one of few media corporations that is allowed to interview or report on Arasaka operations. Besides corporations, Arasaka has many allies within various nations in the world. Finally the corporation has strong ties with underground organizations such as the variousYakuzaclans,Triads, and even theTyger Claws.
Like most megacorporations, Arasaka is frequently accused of unethical practice such as blackmail, bribery, extortion, and hiring mercenaries for covert, illegal operations. These mercenary operations could include suppressing legal demonstrations, assassinations, and abductions of high-level corporate experts and officials. The Arasaka Corporation was officially found guilty by the verdict ofGeneral Lundee's commission of the detonation of a thermonuclear device in the Night City Corporate Plaza in 2023. The result of the investigation have been openly and repeatablely questioned.[5]In 2077, after the official announcement of theRelicprogram, many people as well as Religious organizations saw the project as inhuman and disturbing.

Militech International Armamentsis amegacorporationspecializing in weapons manufacturing and private military contracting. Militech is one of the world's largest manufacturers of weapons and military vehicles, with facilities on every continent.[1]
Militech provides equipment for numerous nations as well as both private and governmental organizations, especially theNUSAmilitaryand police forces. This equipment includes but is not limited to personal firearms, drones, tanks, aircraft, ships, and Assisted Combat Personal Armor.
An alternate branch of the corporation provides private military forces ostensibly for the purposes of defense, peacekeeping and nation-building missions, however these forces have been used to aid terrorist organizations and military coups in the past.
Founded initially in1996by Italian weapons designerAntonio Luccessias Armatech-Luccessi International, Militech, as it's known today, began its journey with the1998trials for a new standardized US Infantry assault weapon.[2]
Despite continued bankruptcy and ongoing recovery from the economiccollapse of 1994, theUS governmentdecided the time had come to replace theM-16A2. The trials ultimately revealed three finalists: the FN SAP, a cheap but clunky and unreliable weapon, considered mainly due to powerful ties between the company Fabrique International and the US government, as well as its ammunition and parts compatibility with other members of the by then defunctNATOalliance; theColtAR-17X, a good but expensive weapon; and a submission by newcomer Armatech-Luccessi International, a compact, reliable and moderately priced rifle.
USMC GeneralDonald Lundee, a member of the Joint Chiefs overseeing the trials, was quickly sold on the Armatech system, assessing it as being the best combination of price, reliability, sturdiness and accuracy. Unfortunately, due to the collapse of the US economy and near collapse of the government, the national defense budget had not only tightened but also become insidiously coupled with industry influence that had crept into the political infrastructure and, in spite of General Lundee's protests, the contract for the new US Infantry weapon system went to FN.
In2003, during theSecond South American Conflict, US soldiers had been dying in the thousands equipped with unreliable SAP rifles terribly suited for the tropical climate. Lundee had observed this from afar however, having resigned from the Marine Corps shortly after the trials of 1998 to become the CEO of Armatech, at the request of Luccessi. As a former Pentagon chief, he possessed a profound understanding of the modern military-industrial complex, including the extent to which older military contracting corporations had become incredibly bureaucratically top heavy, often touting shoddy and overpriced products that sold through contractual inertia alone.
Lundee saw an opportunity for streamlined and efficient military manufacturing - producing high quality, modern equipment at competitive prices, with the capability to sell technology in the global market regardless of political convention. This pitch, coupled with Luccessi's brilliance in weapons design, allowed Armatech to acquire the capital needed to propel the company into a period of rapid expansion. Armatech's new world prominence and overt visibility came with a new name in2002, Militech Arms International.
The corporation's first major success came in2004. Given the disaster represented by the Central American Wars, the US finally scrapped the FN SAP and began new trials for a standardized infantry assault weapon. The resulting choice was theMilitech Ronin Light Assault Rifleand, shortly afterwards, Militech also won the military side arm contract, directly resulting in sales of these weapons in vast quantities around the globe to nations and corporations alike. At the same time, Militech had begun development of heavy weapon systems, artillery, armored vehicles and aircraft. This greatly expanded catalogue, coupled with the brand's moderate prices and excellent quality, enabled the company to take on several key contracts, winning them over established defense manufacturers that had operated through and beyond the economic collapse.
By the mid2010s, Militech was the largest defense contractor in several countries, including the U.S, as well as being utilized by a number of corporations, all of which allowed the company to absorb a number of its now failing competitors in order to incorporate their designers and resources.[2]
However despite great success, Militech suffered from internal problems. While Donald Lundee was never doubted leadership or executive abilities, the board of directors did not see him in a favorable light. Lundee was power hungry and did not hide it, he was determined to make Militech the largest force onEarth. During this time Lundee would often put up the corporation and himself against the Japanese conglomerateArasaka. This rose tensions between the corporations with many that feared a corporate war could break out, these decisions left the various members of the corporation in disagreement. Even Lundee's friend and ally ColonelEmile Lazarusdid not favor this choice of direction.
By2020, an ex-president of MilitechElizabeth Kressbecame the president of the United States benefiting the corporation. CEO Donald Lundee became paranoid of those who opposed him, while not having complete control of the company many were loyal to him leading to much internal conflict.
In2021, during the escalation of conflict between rival aquacorpsCINOandOTEC, Militech's defense forces were contracted as supplementary support for OTEC's security forces, as well as to provide advisors, weapons and supplies.[3]Initially, Militech's ambitions in this conflict were not to directly engage in combat withArasaka, but to advertise and demonstrate the efficacy of their defense services in the world market. However toDonald Lundeeit was a matter of pride to defeat the Japanese, andSaburo Arasaka. By the end of 2021, both OTEC and CINO were engaged in naval warfare, both above and below the surface, as Arasaka and Militech moved into position and conducted early covert operations.[4]
Lundee considered Militech to be at war, and being a soldier for much of his life, could only view Militech's victory as Arasaka's utter defeat.[3]The "Ocean War" between CINO and OTEC officially ended in February of2022with a peace accord signed on the 27th of that month. Only 7 days later on March 6th, Arasaka conducted a live trial of the newly completedSoulkiller2.5, capturing the engram of a Militech executive, the interrogation of whom led to an Arasaka strike on Militech's Night City offices.[3]
During the fall of 2022, following worldwide conflict and warring overspill from the corporate conflict, governments began reigning in the two megacorporations. Southern California andTexasin the U.S consequently opted to nationalize Arasaka and Militech facilities, with theEECthreatening to follow suit if tensions failed to diminish.[3]Shortly after, the war reached a turning point when Arasaka forces invaded a Militech showroom in Italy, causing the EEC to make good on their promise, seizing assets owned by both corporations throughout Europe.Japanfollowed the EEC, nationalizing Arasaka assets within its borders and its surrounding territories.[3]
On August 20th, 2023, a Militech strike team, including infamous charactersJohnny Silverhand,Rogue,Spider Murphy, andShaitan, entered theArasaka Towersfrom its rooftop and deployed a small nuclear weapon within Saburo's office. The violent blast resulted in the complete destruction of the tower, with ejected debris precipitating widespread destruction to the surrounding city. 12,000 people were instantly killed withinCorporate Center, followed by half a million in the surrounding areas, with a further quarter million dying in the hours and days after.[5]
TheNew United States, led byPresident Elizabeth Kressdeclared martial law in the parts of the country still under their control. She blamedArasakafor the mini nuke detonated in Night City, but rumors persisted that Militech had funded the strike team and supplied them with the portable nuclear device. Kress despite the public demands to hold Militech responsible, never addressed the concerns. Instead she nationalized Militech, and used them to strengthen their federal rule. Some of the most prominent and exonerated Militech officials were offered lucrative positions in the re-formed NUS Department of Defense. This didn't go over well with Militech's hotheaded and proud CEO, Donald Lundee.[4]
Even as the Megacorp labored under control fromWashington, D.C.as a nationalized Corporate asset, Militech secretly was rebuilding back to its former role as a combination of arms manufacturer and mercenary army. Despite heavy wartime losses, Militech remained one of world's largest producer and seller of all manner of military weapons. As well as a major military supplier to what was the re-uniting New United States, as well as being it's largest customer. Donald Lundee remained in power and one of the most influential people on the Board of Directors.[4]However he didn't own enough stock to control the Corporation, his force of personality, allies, and success record had kept him on top despite internal struggles.
Over the years, Lundee set himself and Militech up againstArasakaso often and for so long that he became personally involved, making it a matter of pride to defeat the Japanese and their attempt to take over the global arms market, for he had also made it his goal to do so. Due to his arrogance and aggressive demeanor, Lundee had made more enemies than friends.[4]That very same temper and arrogance that resulted in a dogged determination to see the war through to the bitter end, only brought to heel by President Kress' reactivation of his commission, and her command to cease hostilities.
In 2077, Militech still maintained the title of one of the largest manufacturers of weapons and military vehicles in the world. They've worked closely with American military and police agencies for decades, providing high-grade weaponry and training.[6]After nationalization of Militech, the NUSA used its assets to strengthen the collapsing power of the country. The corporation had since regained some of its independence, and several of its board members still held high-ranking offices in the Ministry of Defense.[1]Due to the efforts of ex-Militech employees, the NUSA was responsible for over 60% of the corporation's contracts.[7]
During this time Militech produced and released theCorporate Wars: The Musicalmovie which saw mixed reviews with many praising the film for its story and musical numbers. Others criticized movie for its melodramatic plot and propaganda.[7]
InNight City, Militech was also considered the second biggest and best corporation to work for, in part due to giving its employees up to 50% discounts on all Militech weapons.[8]
PresidentRosalind Myersannounced that she'd be seeking another term as president, though many protested her running again. She was the previous CEO of the Militech Corporation, and with many members of the board being higher ups in the Pentagon, theNUSAand Militech interests and assets were largely one and the same. Many people wished to oppose Militech's control over the NUSA.Washington, D.C.serves as Militech's largest consumer, and should the capital ever run out of money, the corporation would risk losing everything. Militech announced plans to construct a new colony onMars, and began selling residential modules.[7]
Militech's a weapons manufacturer, Militech products are sold in varying volumes to eighty-two countries and over 250 corporations, not to mention millions upon millions of individuals, groups, gangs and small companies around the world.
The Militech products that are most visible to the man on the street are its small arms. Militech sells more pistols, rifles and sub-machine guns than any other single manufacturer in the world. Bulk shipments are bought by national and corporate armies, police departments, militias, security groups and so on. Individual weapons are sold over the counter by hundreds of thousands of dealers. Militech's high sales are due in part to a hard won reputation for producing a tough, reliable and accurate products at a reasonable price. On top of that, sizable discounts are available to bulk purchasers. TheMilitech Roninis still the top selling assault rifle in the world, several years after its release. Part of this is due to the U.S. Army contract, but much of it is due to strong private sales.
Another factor is the huge selection available. Among Militech's small arms products are small, derringer type weapons, special load revolvers, hundreds of the best pistol, rifle and sub-machinegun models in the world, sporting arms, special purpose weapons such as long range sniping rifles, squad automatic weapons, full size machine guns, and shotguns. Each model has options. This means that any small arms needs you may have can be filled by one company. This is an advantage to bulk contractors, like armies and corporations, who would prefer to have to deal with only one maintenance and resupply contract.[2]
There are four main departments of heavy weapons manufacture: Airborne Delivery Systems, Non-Projectile Ordinance, Artillery and Heavy Projectile Systems, and Light Projectile Systems. Within the company, these departments are known by their initials, ADS, NPO, AHPS and LPS. Airborne delivery specializes in missiles and bombs. They design and manufacture Militech's extensive line of air to air, surface to air and surface to surface missiles, also unguided rockets, and general and special purpose bombs of several varieties. Non-Projectile Ordinance is the department responsible for research, development and manufacture of things like land-mines, grenades, satchel charges, demolitions packages, and specialized explosives such as liquids, gels, plastiques, micro-caps and det-cords. This department also produces the explosives used by Airborne Delivery in their warheads. Artillery is just what it says. They design and produce both the guns themselves and the shells that they fire, again using Non-Projectile Ordinance's explosives. Artillery's products include everything from super-long range weapons to light mortars, grenade launchers, and man-portable antiarmor rockets. They also make the heavy guns that mount on top of tanks, armored cars, and some armored personnel carrier chassis. Light Projectile Weapons makes such things as twenty and thirty millimeter cannons, vulcan-type multi-barrel machine guns, and other heavy machine guns. Many of these weapons find their way atop armored vehicles with Artillery's products, or into aircraft.[2]
Although many components of Militech's vehicles are subcontracted, their catalog includes light wheeled vehicles, armored personnel carriers, armored cars, tanks, armored hovercraft, small boats and sub-marines, large ships, vectored thrust aircraft, and true jet aircraft. Many of these products are manufactured under the name of subsidiary firms, but it usually doesn't take much searching to find the "A Militech Company" caption somewhere near their logo. Many of these companies were former competitors that Militech hammered into financial oblivion and bought during its period of rapid expansion in the early2010s.
Militech branded vehicles are sold mostly to nations and corporations. There are, however, a few extremely wealthy individuals out there whose private security troops have some Militech armored cars or vectored-thrust attack craft at their disposal.[2]
Militech markets a variety of military and paramilitary accessories, and this group of products accounts for much of the corporation's sales to private individuals. Many products in the diverse accessory line are appealing to people who have no need for firepower and no interest in military items also sell in large numbers to the same people and organizations who purchase weapons systems. The wide demographic appeal of the accessories makes them second only in small arms in terms of sales volume for Militech.
Naturally, there are also thousands of other items in the Militech accessory catalogue, including body armor, clothing, field rations, knives, weapons accessories, vehicular accessories, books and information disks, security equipment, exotic melee and ranged weapons, survival equipment and so on. These items are sold at showrooms, and available through mail order from catalogs available on hyperstack disk or in print.[2]
Militech has highly secretive research and development facilities where work on potentially profitable new weapons and accessory systems is carried out. These facilities are also the site of what are known within the corporation as Special Projects. The Special Projects Department is the group responsible for the development of those ideas considered too exotic, sensitive, potentially dangerous, or PR. damaging for regular development channels. All security around Special Projects people and development sites is fearsome, with only the most trusted and experienced of troops and security agents being used. The threat of extraction or corporate espionage against the Special Projects Department is so high that Militech has been known to order the assassination of some of its own lower executives who have been accidentally exposed to sensitive SPD data.
The Special Projects Department's programs had been rumored to include the genetic and biochemical alteration of human beings and animals to produce more durable battlefield soldiers and guard animals, second generation combat drugs that can provide the desired effects without burning out the soldier or producing messy addictions, short-term biological agents that can sterilize a large area and then revert to harmless states within hours or minutes, refined ballistic body armors that can stop high energy projectiles and then dissipate the kinetic energy so that the wearer doesn't suffer the crushing impact of a non-penetrating bullet; tiny, cybernetically controlled assassination robots, and satellite and portable battlefield model high energy beam weapons for anti-ship and armor use.[2]
Militech contracts police services to cities around the world. Militech's police services department is smaller than that of its rival,Arasaka, however it is much more common in theUnited Statesthan Arasaka's police group. Although Arasaka does contract police services in several U.S. cities, because of the competition Militech has be unable to contract any of it's services inJapanand other areas in Asia and Europe. Militech has attempted to become more accessible to these nations, however it has been made increasingly difficult.[2]
Militech maintains a large standing army by most corporate standards and hires its troops out as a service to their corporations, nations and wealthy individuals. Militech's mercenaries are neither as specialized as Arasaka's primarily security-oriented troops nor as diverse as theLazarus Group's variety of multi-purpose soldiers and agents. Except in special situations, Militech hires out only all-purpose, line soldiers. They are competent troops, trained for a variety of special situations, including airborne, amphibious and all-terrain operations, but they are not special forces soldiers, and they lack the experience necessary for most special ops or super-specialized missions. Militech has no shortage of specialized troops, but it retains them for its own use. Militech's soldiers are generally contracted out to corporations or nations for basic infantry reinforcement in urban or field situations. Force sizes range from a one hundred man minimum to a ten thousand man maximum, depending on availability. Anyone requiring specialized troops or troops in greater or lesser numbers than those offered by Militech is referred to the Lazarus group.
Militech has been known to let other companies or nations use its special ops troops, but this typically happens only when the corporation has something other than contract money to gain from the operation. For instance, Militech would lease special ops troops to a smaller company who wanted to attempt an espionage mission, but only if that mission would damage a Militech competitor or lead to an increase in business for one of Militech's departments. Alternatively, Militech has been known to let small companies use its special ops troops to steal secrets that it has wanted for itself. The corporation has then taken over the smaller company and absorbed all its assets and data. This method has the advantage of divorcing the corporation one step from any blame for the operation, but it is usually only employed when Militech was already planning a buyout of the smaller company.
The Militech Corporation has struggled with public relations since it's inception as a Megacorporation. Militech is often seen as a reliable corporation for supplies and weapons alike, however the corporation itself is seen as a danger especially within theNUSA. Over the decades the corporation has had it's control over the NUSA and uses much of it's resources and capital to benefit themselves for expansion. However the board of directors have attempted to change this image of the corporation by supplying the police and army with much needed defensive arsenal, as well as contracting it's forces to stabilize and secure the NUSA from the threat ofnomadclans. Militech has also been responsible for sponsoring shows and providing cyberware or computer components to people who require them. At the same time Militech uses it's influence to bring a negative agenda and propaganda towards foreign influences, mainly Asian or European influences.
In 2020, Lundee's envy of the Arasaka chief and theArasaka Corporationin general, was widely known. Many experts expected the regular scraps between Militech and Arasaka to explode into full scale war some-time before2030. This prediction was soon seen in theFourth Corporate War.
Militech's attempts to monopolize the arms industry have made it the natural enemy of many other arms companies, as well as that of several larger corporations that have weapons manufacturing subsidiaries. Among the more vociferous and troublesome of Militech's weapons industry enemies were independentsSternmeyer WaffenfabrikSA andFederated Arms. Larger corporations that Militech had tensions with wereSchumann-SteinandIECconglomerates.
During the 2010s, Militech's closest corporate ally was theLazarus Group. In addition, ColonelEmile Lazarusand General Lundee knew each other from their days in the military and are personal friends. However, Col. Lazarus disagreed with his friend's antagonistic views of Arasaka, and disliked the shift in Lundee's thinking, away from the pursuit of military excellence, and toward the fulfillment of personal power goals.
Militech had managed to irritate several national governments around the world, mostly because it supplies their enemies, but none of those small countries have the power to cause Militech much trouble beyond their borders. Militech's closest national ally is theNUSA. As far as international influence goes that's strictly a zero, since, following the Collapse, the phrase "American International Power" is widely considered oxymoronic.[2]
Militech is often accused of taking part in ethically shady or blatantly illegal black ops, such as hiring out their private military to support revolutions, military coups, assassinations, terrorist attacks, and ethnic cleansings. The company was also suspected of planting and detonating the nuclear bomb in Arasaka's Night City headquarters in 2023, though no evidence has ever validated those claims.[1]
In 2077, Militech has been caught massacring innocent citizens of theNUSA. 75% of the victims of the massacres had been identified as Japanese. Along with much evidence towards the corporation, many have suspected Militech to be against foreign influence in the country. For decades the Presidents of the NUSA have been previous higher ups or even CEO of the Megacorporation which has led to Militech gaining much support from the government. Citizens of the NUSA have fought against the hold Militech has had on the country, however no success has been seen.
Militech has also been shown to disregard veterans of their corp military after they retire, these veterans were often discovered without proper medication or were even massacred by Militech themselves. These massacres had also lend to a poor relationship with the various nomads within the NUSA.
Militech is one of the Big-Ten corporations in the world—number six to be exact. The corporation's diverse line of products, its wide ranging subsidiaries, and the huge 2020 market for weapons and military accessories all contribute to its success. Analysts have projected continued growth for Militech over the next several years, and it is no secret that the board of directors is eyeing a spot in the top five. That would put Militech in the company of other megacorps asEBM,Arasaka,International Electricand so on.
In 2020, Militech's total value in assets and holdings was€$432 billion, putting it only €$50 billion behind number one,Euro Business Machines, and €$43 billion behind the corporation's main competitor, Arasaka. Militech's €$432 billion worth was divided among a variety of assets and holdings. Unlike some other large corporations, Militech has no bank attached to it, and couldn't count outstanding loans and interest toward its assets. Yet, it does have prodigious annual sales, and the profit value of those contracts and sales are considered part of the corporation's worth.[2]After Militech was nationalized by theNUSA, made possible from ex-employeeElizabeth Kress, the corporation shared it's monetary value with the country. This raised Militech's assets and holdings to €$1.2 trillion.[7]
Militech is a public corporation with 430 million shares of common stock on the world market.Donald Lundeehad claimed ownership of 8%.Roland Yeeand the board of directors lay claim to another 22%. Considering these numbers, it seemed that there is a controlling amount of Militech stock that could become the target of a lever-aged group acquisition. Several large corporations will form a temporary alliance to perpetrate a leveraged buyout and hostile take-over of a mutual enemy. The unlucky target corporation will then see its assets broken up and divided among the raiders. Frequently, fighting breaks out among the "allied" corporations over who gets to absorb certain desirable parts of the target corporation, but its usually happens too late for the breakdown to be of any use to the victim.[2]
This is Militech's big advantage over many of its competitors. As it is an arms manufacturer, its corporate army is better equipped than most others, with a high volume of state of the art weaponry, vehicles and accessories. This has helped Militech to hold its own militarily against its well armed nemesis, Arasaka.[2]
Militech and its subsidiaries employee about 680,000 people worldwide. Of these, 300,000 work directly under the Militech name, and 100,000 of those are corporate troops. Of Militech's 100,000 troops, a maximum of 80% may be used for contract work at any given time, and 20% are retained full time for corporate defense. Typically, only 50% are hired out at any one time. 90%of the troops are standard guards, line soldiers and specialists (pilots, artillery gunners, etc.), 10% are special ops troops, solos and agents who are never subcontracted out, but retained for Militech's personal use.[2]
The Militech International Armaments Corporation core companies are Militech Technologies (the main weapons arm), Militech Military Contracting (mercenaries), and Militech International (holding). These represent the greatest share of Militech's sales and business and are the branches that own and manage the network of smaller subsidiary companies.
Just a few Militech subsidiaries include: Militech Technologies, Militech Military Contracting, Militech International, Militech America, Militech EEC, Militech Asia, Militech Personnel Services, Militech Police Services, Militech Heavy Industries, Militech Computers Inc., Militech Avionics Inc., Combat Fashion Inc., Militech Showrooms Inc., Militech International Shipping, Militech Maritime Construction Inc (shipyards), Militech Cybernetics International, Militech Aerospace Inc., Allisson Field Artillery Systems, Kunoshita Chipware, Kwikee Stop (convenience stores), Chouinard Electrodyne International, Klemperer Photo-Optical Systems, and Speedy Eddy's Pizza Restaurants.[2]
Militech regional offices can range in size from towers comparable to their Rosslyn headquarters to smaller one room offices staffed by a signal representative. Most major cities have a fair sized Militech office building for the handling of local distribution, management and contract sales, and at least one or two showrooms for retail sales. Regional offices handle all local bulk arms contracts, mercenary contracting, distribution, and other paperwork. Regional offices also contain the headquarters for the local ranking Militech Officer. This individual, with his other staff, is responsible for overseeing and coordinating all local military endeavors and black operations. They answer directly to the district operations coordinator back in Rosslyn. Major Militech regional offices can be found inNew York City,Chicago, San Francisco,Los Angeles,Night City, Mexico City, Rio De Janiero, Bogota,Tokyo, Beijing, London, Berlin, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, Cairo and Nairobi. Smaller offices can be located worldwide as well as showrooms containing their products.
Across the Potomac from Washington D.C., located just a few hundred meters from the HQ of theLazarus Group, standing eighty-two stories tall and taking up an entire city block the Militech Tower is the center of US and global operations for the arms manufacturing megacorporation.
The Tower's architecture can be best described as unimaginative: a square tower that goes straight up for eighty-two stories with the only piece of stylistic design being the all-around cantilever on the ground floor, other than that concrete columns rise from the ground to support the edge of the fourth floor where the cantilever begins with a forty foot high glass wall with steel supporting members standing behind the columns and rings the bottom three stories around the base of the tower. Unlike theLazarusorArasakabuildings Militech does not have a concourse or plaza surrounding its headquarters with it instead connecting directly to the rather large side walk that wraps around the whole building.
As for the interior the first three floors are open to the public and designed as airy galleries with the ground floor having large green areas filled with exotic plants and criss-crossed with small ponds and streams with small all designed to hide the extensive security systems dotted through the ground floor. The second floor is a large showroom where Militech products are displayed and has plenty of helpful sales agents for potential customers. Finally the third floor contains and open air cafeteria and restaurant as well as a small military technology museum and offices for recruiting and sales staff.
Beyond the public spaces the Tower also houses an infirmary in an underground area, auditoriums, R&D facilities, firing range, conference centers, communication hubs, machine shop/fabrication center, offices, short stay rooms, luxury suites, and no less that four full-scale world situation/war rooms which the company uses not so much for running wars, as for keeping tabs on other people's wars for marketing and research reasons.[2]
When your average citizen thinks of Militech, the showroom is what he or she is most likely to recall. Everyone who lives in or near a major city has been in, or at least seen, a Militech showroom. Located in corporate areas or commercial malls, showrooms are how Militech sells its products to the general population. Depending on the location and typical clientele the showrooms can range from glitzy, rock pumping, teen oriented affairs offering polymer one shots and personal accessories and defense systems to quiet, elegant, civilized complexes where wealthy executives and high class solos receive personal demonstrations of the most up to date and exclusive systems. These are extremes, however, and the typical downtown showroom is designed to cater to all prospective clients, offering a little of each world to shoppers.
Although some showrooms, such as the suburban mall variety, are small, and offer only small arms and personal accessories, most of the downtown ones are quite large, occupying several rooms, and sometimes multiple stories in their host buildings. They will have a courteous sales staff trained in the use of the products they sell, and, of course, a contingent of soldiers and guards on hand to fill the multiple roles of security and demonstration. On hand will be a stock of the latest models of those Militech weapons and accessories which are legal for sale to the public or to solos with special permits. For executives and representatives of police departments and other potential large-scale clients there will be demo tapes and chips of military and paramilitary grade weapons.
Sometimes there will be tanks, AVs, or other vehicles parked on the showroom floor like in an auto dealership. Although the vehicles are there for display purposes they are always combat ready, and can be brought into service within minutes. The Night City downtown showroom currently has two of the brand new, evil-looking AVX Viper assault aerodynes on display. These have not only attracted representatives of several local corporations for a look, but many casual shoppers have peeked in to get a gander at the exotic looking craft and left with some item for their home or personal defense collection. Shoppers can try their hand on an AVX simulator, and there are AVX T-shirts and lollipops for the kiddies. There is always a crowd at the large showrooms. All shoppers should be advised, however, that shoplifters will be prosecuted, if they live long enough to make it to court.
Besides functioning as retail outlets, showrooms also serve as recruiting stations, and any promising youngster or solo who wants to try his or her hand with the Militech Corporate forces is welcome to come on down for a personal interview, no appointment necessary.[2]
Located near the town of Laconia, New Hampshire, is the Small arms R&D program where Militech tests all of its small arms models as well those of their competition. The site of the old Armatech offices the six buildings and two firing ranges that make up the facility are for designing and testing only, with only one building housing the machine shops and fabrication areas needed for creating prototypes and test models.
The Small Arms facility is not designed for full scale production, only design and testing. One building contains machine shops and fabrication areas, but they are sufficient only for producing prototypes and test models. Once a product has been approved for mass production and ordered by Militech or a corporate client the design specs are sent to the Militech small arms
factories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or Albstadt, Germany.[2]
Militech's primary research facility is located near Norfolk, Virginia, compared to the more specialised locations across the globe the general R&D facility in Virginia serves as a catch-all for those programs that don't fit in with any of the specific departments, but that are not heavy enough to fall under the jurisdiction of the Special Projects Department. This site itself has two large scale fabrication facilities and warehouses for the construction and storage of large scale projects that would otherwise tax the capabilities of the regional offices. The R&D department also makes up a large part of the industrial park on the outskirts of Norfolk containing large scale manufacturing areas, warehouses, offices and extensive security.[2]
Located deep in the heart of New Mexico, south of route 42 and wedged between highways 54 and 285 is Militech's Proving Grounds, 5000 square kilometres of scrub and desert where the corporation tests its new weapons and equipment. Known within the company as "The Garden" the site itself occupies a rectangular area approximately 50 kilometres wide and 100 kilometres long and encompasses several types of terrain from hills to canyons and included facilities such as an airfield, administration building, warehouses, fabrication areas, barracks, executive residences, corporate village and research labs. With millions of eurodollars worth of equipment tested at the Proving Grounds security is extremely extensive will remote sensor and counter-intrusion systems littered throughout the grounds, a constantly monitored and hot-wired perimeter fence and even Militech DIS-5 satellites in geosynchronous orbit constantly monitoring the site.[2]
Three kilometres from the Proving Grounds corporate village is solitary, squat building with tinted windows
and a featureless grey paint job, this is the location of the Special Projects Department where Militech's most advanced research takes place. Extending ten stories below ground the SPD is bristling with defence systems and houses biomedical, computer and chemistry labs, a sophisticated fabrication area, research surgery O.R.s, testing areas, and living facilities for up to 200 personnel.[2]
Militech maintains a standing army of over 100,000 troops. Usually, 40-50,000 of these are on lease to corporations or governments around the world. The remainder either live on their own, at Militech postings, or they live at one of Militech's combination training camp/troop barrack facilities. Militech has the provisions to barrack about 50% of its troops at any given time. If less than 40,000 troops are out on contract at any time, the overflow live on call. Militech has seven large camps; each can support about 7,000 troops. The camps are located around the world, each in an area which offers unique training opportunities. The artillery/armor/flight training is at Camp Patton, Texas. Swamp/jungle training is at Camp Jackson, in southern Florida. Mountain/snow training is at Camp Whitmore, in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Underwater/maritime training is at Concord Station, Connecticut, near the Militech Shipyards. Special forces/special-ops training is at the highly secret Camp Raney, Georgia. In addition, there are Militech Camps inEnglandandJapan, giving access to the European and Asian theaters. All camps do basic infantry training and recruitment and have tight security. Facilities at the Militech camps always include an airfield, barracks, recreation areas, training areas and a large complement of artillery, armor and aircraft.[2]
Militech and its subsidiaries have manufacturing plants in several countries. A few of the more important ones are the Aircraft shops in San Diego, California, the Shipyards in New London, Connecticut, the Vehicle Factories in San Jose, California, the Cyberware/ Computer/Accessory plant inNight City, the Ordinance plants in Manila,New Philippinesand Amsterdam, Holland, and the small arms factories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Albstadt,Germany.[2]

Kang Tao was originally headquartered inTaiwan, which had become a manufacturing haven in the late2000s, after the country declared independence with the help ofJapanandArasaka. Kang Tao became an industry giant among the Taiwanese companies. Unlike the rest, it kept its independence by not selling out to Japanese business interests. Kang Tao manufactured weapons that were distributed through Asia and made their way to theUS.[2]
In the2040s, Kang Tao was restructured into a Chinese-based company, making its way to the top tier of weapons manufacturing at a tremendous pace thanks to bold choices, courageous strategy, and government backing.[3]In 2077, the corporation was mainly known for its firearms, especially their newest generation of so-called "smart-guns", weapons that employed gyrojet technology to fire caseless guided ammunition, but were also becoming important players in the mercenary and security markets.
Kang Tao remained independent inTaiwanas its small firearm manufacturing division was widely successful. Their pistols became very popular among the streets of Asia with many gangers opting for the reliable and inexpensive brand.[2]
When theDataKrashoccurred, the CEO of Kang Tao at the time committed suicide.[4]
In the years after theFourth Corporate War, Asia was ravaged by war and unrest which left many countries crippled and deeply scarred.Chinawas no exception as it recovered from internal turmoil, but its years of rebuilding and recovery were also a time of great opportunity. The restructuring of Kang Tao began in2046with the appointment of a former army colonel,Shiming Xu, to manage what was considered an obsolete and collapsing corporation kept afloat by government subsidies. After four years under Colonel Xu's direction, the modernized and debt-free firm officially debuted on the market in2050with theirA-22B Chao"smart" pistol. Thanks to the company's alleged government connections, the corporation invested heavily in modern research facilities, rapidly expanding the "smart weapons" market. Throughout the next 20 years, through new research facilities funded by the government, Kang Tao overcame its old rivals, coming out as a top-tier weapon manufacturer on par with Tsunami Arms and Arasaka.
Since2072, Kang Tao had tripled its stock value, becoming a leading weapon exporter in Asia. The past fifty years of war and unrest left many Asian countries crippled and deeply scarred.[1]
In 2077, an explosion at a company refinery in Hangzhou left over 50,000 dead. Although official accounts cleared the corporation of negligence, many still blamed them for the explosion.[1]That same year, Kang Tao expressed interest in thePacificadistrict ofNight City. The city council responded explaining that they would sell the district for cheap, if Kang Tao agreed to clear out the area of all crime. No official deals had been made.
Kang Tao was also considered the fourth biggest and best corporation to work for inNight City. It provides employees with aTrauma TeamGold insurance package. At the same time, Kang Tao requires employees to sign a 50-year loyalty pledge.[5]
Public relations for Kang Tao have broadly remained the same since its restructuring in the2050s. Kang Tao's relations with the Chinese government have kept it out of trouble in the past, and most nations generally recognized it as a Megacorporation worth doing business with. However, its relations with other corporations are strained, as Kang Tao has made various efforts to steal from competitors.[6]
Kang Tao has had the reputation for being negligent in its various endeavors. The corporation has been involved with the death of thousands of citizens and employees due to its operations, and also has a reputation for stealing much research from other corporations in its field. While Kang Tao is aggressive, it manages to keep many of its controversial operations secret.[1]

It createdTriticum vulgaris megasuavis, the genus of wheat that is refined into the synthetic grain alcohol/fuelCHOOH2, and licenses the rights to use it to various petrochemical companies.[2][3]It is the largest biotech company in the world, specializing in genetic engineering and biotechnical, pharmaceutical and microbiological research.[4][5]
When the fuel crisis started to affect the industrial business in the late1990s, Biotechnica, then a small company with a single office, came up with the answer:CHOOH2, a complex grain alcohol produced by genetically engineered yeasts and wheat strains. The potential of CHOOH2 was quickly realized, and within a few years many vehicles and power plants had converted to the new fuel.[6]
Despite holding global patents, Biotechnica lacked the production facilities to meet global demand, forcing it to license production to several large agribusinesses and petro-corporations, mainlyPetrochemandSovOil. These transactions made Biotechnica a very wealthy company.[6]Besides utilizing the licensing rights of CHOOH2 to other corporations, Biotechnica has a multitude ofbiowareproducts on the market.
Biotechnica is always looking into more breakthroughs and is constantly expanding. They have facilities all over the world, includingRome,Venice,Berlin,Bonn,Paris,London,Hamamatsu,La Jolla,Seattle,Dallas,Night City,SydneyandRio de Janeiro.
Biotechnica's labs have provided much of the tech that enabled thePacifica Confederationto develop new bio-engineered "replacement species," and Biotechnica is active in restoring both animals and habitat throughout the blighted environments of this era.[7]
Over the years Biotechnica genetically engineered a number of crops that could be farmed even with the drastic changes in Earth's climate. Most popular of these wasFrostCorn, a hybrid species the company engineered to be adaptable to all climate conditions. The megacorporation sold licenses to cultivate FrostCorn to both national and local governments, most notablyAlaska,[8][9]as well as small, private farms. These annual licensing fees over the years slowly depleted the budgets of smaller businesses and forced more and more of them to sell their land to Biotechnica itself. Eventually, these farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs formedCrimson Harvest, an anti-corporate organization demanding that Biotechnica stops its extortionate practices. In response to Crimson Harvest's peaceful protests Biotechnica increased their prices even more, and was rumored to have unleashed a virus that hurt any crops grown from unlicensed grain. As the situation got worse, the organization became more radical. The tensions remained high until the bloodiest incident took place in a Biotechnica facility in Paris, after which Crimson Harvest was recognized as a terrorist organization. This seemingly escalated the conflict by a lot, with more anti-corporate fanatics joining Crimson Harvest and making it more dangerous than it ever was.[10]
Biotechnica started out as a small company based out ofRome,Italy. In1991, amidst an energy crisis, Biotechnica developedCHOOH2, a substitute for fossil fuel. At the time, they weren't a big enough corporation to keep up with the demand, and so they decided to sell the exclusive license for the production and distribution of the product toPetrochem. CHOOH2 eventually became the standard fuel around the world. Capitalizing on its success, the board of directors sold the license to 14 other manufacturers around the world, includingSovOil, but Petrochem remained responsible for 60% of the world's supply[2]with the largest amount of soil to grow the yeast needed for production.
Biotechnica's products raised their capital by a huge margin and it eventually became a megacorporation. Biotechnica started making deals withArasaka, and settled on a mutual beneficial agreement, providing troops in exchange for exclusive biological weapons.
Biotechnica's second major discovery was kept secret due to it being illegal in the majority of countries. In2004,Francis Youngwas successful in human cloning experiments, however it wasn't until 16 years later, in2020, that he succeeded in producing the first self-aware fully functional human clone by implanting it with a construct personality. Initially, this development was artificial, but soon enough they began experimenting to insert natural digitized personalities in clones using something similar in tech to theSoulkiller. The mainR&D cloning facilityof Biotechnica located inNight Cityhad a staff of about 200 scientists and security.
The biggest goal for Biotechnica was to bring back the flora and the fauna that changed significantly in the 1990s due to climate changes. They held facilities worldwide specializing in this field, slowly trying to rebuild the environment.
In the2020sBiotechnica created a natural park in Night City, known as theLake Park. They also cloned animals in an attempt to preserve them and sell to people for a high profit margin.
TheFourth Corporate Warsaw Biotechnica remain as neutral as it possibly could, allowing them to get through the war without many problems. They supplied bothMilitechand Arasaka with weapons and other biological equipment, but, due to their previous deals with Arasaka and their continued support from the company, Arasaka got many exclusive devices behind the scenes.
In the2040s, Biotechnica was the largest biotech company in the world. Their medical and biological advances have led to cheaper cloned organs and limbs as well as the repopulation of several nearly extinct species.
Biotechnica's HQ in Night City at the time was theBiotechnica Campuslocated in theUniversity District.
Biotechnica built theirnew regional HQin Night City's newCorporate Plazawhen the rebuilding began in2052. Biotechnica also invested in the development ofPacificainto a wealthy tourist destination, building the newBiotechnica Venture Centerin the plannedSerenisandssub-district. The project remained unfinished and was eventually abandoned after many delays and the outbreak of theUnification War.
In the2070s, Biotechnica has continued to work towards rebuilding the environment, including restoration of forests and bioengineering previously extinct animal species across the world. In a big breakthrough, Biotechnica's reaserchers brought back three, previously extinct animal species - the North American beaver, the swift fox, and the eastern cottontail.[11]The corporation has also participated in researching various vaccines and future medicine products.[5]Biotechnica offered its employees up to six paid vacation days a year. In2077, the corporation was considered the third best company to work for in Night City.[12]
Biotechnica eventually expanded into food production industry thanks to the income from the annual fees from their fuel and crop licences. In the 2070s, Biotechnica owned many protein farms worldwide, which were used to produce synthetic protein derivatives on a massive scale. One of these facilities was theBiotechnica Flats, located in theSouthern Desertregion of theBadlandson the outskirts of Night City.[13]The Biotechnica Flats became the base source for much of Night City's food. At some point the corporation acquiredAll Foods, a company producing and selling synthetic food and beverages.
In the early2070s,netrunnerSasha Yakovlevainfiltrated the Biotechnica Building to steal confidential information on their projects. By chance, she discovered the information about the undisclosed side effects ofSecuricine, a painkiller made by the corporation. Yakovleva managed to send this information toNetwork 54before being killed by Biotechnica security.[14]
In2076the anti-corporate organizationCrimson Harvestattacked Biotechnica's reaserch facility inParis. Next year, Biotechnica's operativeLinda Shermanfound and followedNele Springer, the likely culprit behind the incident, inDogtown,Night City.[15][16]
Despite the company's advertised positive contribution to society, a team of Biotechnica scientists consisting ofDr. Joanne Koch,Dr. Diana CunoandAleksander Pushkinwas responsible for the deaths of at least 70nomadsof theRed Ocherclan.[17][18][19]The group used the nomad town as a test subject forProject Nightingale, research allegedly related to antibiotics development.[17]To prevent a leak of the incident, Dr. Koch ordered Biotechnica security to have her colleagueEmilia Mortonkilled.[20][21]The information leaked anyway, and corporate higher-ups decided to pin the blame on Dr. Cuno, who then tried to flee the city.[22][23]MediainvestigatorManuel Mendozastarted to look into the project, including hiring a netrunnerDOUBLE_Oto hack into Biotechnica's net through the servers ofImpala Automatics, who were working with Biotechnica at the time, but both of them would be eventually found and killed.[19][24][25][26]
In 2077,Saul Bright, leader of afamilyofAldecaldosstationed outside of Night City, was negotiating with Biotechnica to have his family work for them in exchange for reverse transpiration xerophytes, i.e., equipment to help his clan grow crops in the Badlands and thereby be more self-sufficient.[27]Although Saul sought to enter into a more permanent working relationship with Biotechnica in order to provide his people with a steady income, this notion was very unpopular among his family and, thus, never came to fruition.[28][29][30]

Trauma Team International(TTI) is acorporationthat specializes in rapid response medical services. As the premium paramedical franchise, Trauma Team™ is one of the most notable corporations of the 21st century. The company automatically bills their patients from the moment they receive the order to the location of retrieval.[2]
TTI partners with many corporations such asArasaka,Militech,Night Corp,Biotechnica, orKiroshi, allowing certain employees access to Trauma Team memberships without paying for the service themselves. The medical corporation also manufacturers its own products for the general public to use.
Trauma Team International was founded inSeattle, Washington at some point before 2020. Due to the increased violence and crime rate in theUnited States, it quickly became one of the most powerful corporations in America. Trauma Team International also started operations inCanadaunder the same name, later moving to parts of Europe andJapan.
In 2020, TT boasted over a dozen Trauma Teams on call at any time in any major city. Trauma Team also has a large medicalhospitalinNight City, and they can also be found overseas as Trauma Team Japan located inTokyoand Trauma Team Europe. Made up of the best paramedical techs and staff available, the teams travel within a heavily armored Trauma TeamAV-4supported by mobile tanker trucks and ground refueling stations. The AV-4 itself carries the most sophisticated reviving and life support technology available to the corporation, such as a mobile cryotank.[2]
While responsible for reviving and stabilizing any critically wounded patients, Trauma Teams were under no obligation to transport casualties to a hospital. With rates of€$100 per minute, most Trauma Team services were part of corporate group insurance policies, or individual TT International accounts, with €$500 monthly premiums.
During theFourth Corporate War, TTI became busier than ever before, the company's capabilities had been stretched to their limit. To keep the number of cases down, as well as to preserve their neutrality, Trauma Team declared that they wouldn't respond to any alert from a member of theArasaka CorporationorMilitech. Instead, Trauma Team would only respond to civilian requests, and they'd be charging the combat rate if anyone so much as fired a weapon within half a kilometer. Even with those extra costs, TT was swamped with calls after every clash.
In North America, Trauma Team survived the War, but only as regional providers. The conflict not only drew heavily upon their limited resources, but also upon their suppliers. Repair parts for their fleet of AV-4s and jets were hard to come by, as well as medical dressings, key drugs and vaccines, as well as the trained personnel. As hospitals and clinics collapsed, more and more ill or wounded patients were dropped to Trauma Team care. Not all of these patients could afford TT's high response fees, but groups of edgerunners had been known to chip in to buy a single card that they could break to call in the Trauma Team in the hopes that the TT paramedics would at least tend to their wounded team members.
TT's corporate look as well after the war: in the past, their crisp blue and yellow uniforms were a comforting sign of their competence and capability. But endless street battles and the availability of surplus military hardware had forced the Trauma Team to armor up. The uniforms were still blue, but the new helmets are mil-spec, heavy duty combat rigs, coupled with heavy armor, power armor support systems (yellow), and self-contained combat medipacs. As a result this coupled with the lack of qualified Medtechs, had given Trauma Team a new face: harried, overworked, angry, and impatient. By 2045, Trauma Team International had been reduced to the Neocorp of Trauma Team North America. Trauma Teams were now independent franchise-owned groups patrolling cities and responding to insured victims.[3]
In 2077, Trauma Team International reorganized and retrieved much of its previous assets. As the crime rates went up within the NUSA, TTI raised prices of their services and have been equipped with more arsenal then it had in 2020. Trauma Teams were equipped with theTrauma Team AtlusAVs manufactured byZetatech.Kang Taosupplies TTI with weapons that every team is equipped with.[4]
This plan costs either $500 per month, or $5,550 with a yearly plan discount.
In the event that a Trauma Team is dispatched, the customer/patient also had to pay E$100 for every minute until arrival at the nearest corporate hospital. Finally, the customer/patient also has to pay for the cost of all ammunition that the Trauma Team fired, all of the fuel that was used, and has to pay for any equipment or personnel damage.
If the Trauma Team is not able to reach the customer within 10 minutes, the customer/patient receives 50% off the cost of spent ammunition.[5]
The Corporate Coverage plan costs $1,500 per month, or $16,500 with a yearly plan discount.
The Corporate Executive Coverage plan costs $12,000 per month, or $120,000 with a yearly plan discount.
These plans promise a response time of 7 minutes. The customer/patient is taken to a corporate medical center upon pickup. The customer/patient still has to pay for equipment or personnel damage.
The executive plan covers all ammo and fuel costs, but the customer/patient still has to pay for any equipment or personnel damage.[5]
This plan costs $34,000 per month and does not have a yearly rate.
This plan comes with a gold Trauma Team Inc. card. The response time for this plan is 3-to-5 minutes, which Trauma Team claims is the fastest in the business. Once the customer/patient is picked up, they will be taken to a corporate hospital instead of a medical center. All ammunition and fuel costs are covered, but the customer/patient still has to pay for any equipment or personnel damage.[5]
Operating from an AV-4 Urban Assault Vehicle of ambulance configuration and a belly-mounted minigun, Trauma Teams include a driver, one or more First Aid operatives, and two or more Solo security agents. A Dispatcher may also be part of the team, in charge of sending them on missions.[3]
In 2045, Trauma Team demand increased, requiring the corporation to change their coverage plans to reflect the state of the world, reducing their level of coverage to two levels: Silver and Executive. Most CorporateCopsreceive full medical coverage from Trauma Team. Execs can receive Corporate-paid Silver coverage at Teamwork Rank 6, being upgraded to Executive automatically at Rank 8.[6]
Silver coverage plans cost €$500 per month, and are charged for surgery, equal to the cost of being charged at a hospital. If members do not wish to pay extra for hospital treatments, the Trauma Team will do everything in their paramedical abilities before dropping the member off at a hospital.[6]
This plan costs €$1,000 per month, including the same benefits as Silver coverage, but surgery treatments are provided at no extra cost.[6]
Trauma Team services are comprised of two main components:
On-the-ground servicesincludes 24/7 emergency AV dispatch with a reflex booster-ready pilot, armed safety experts, and military-trained paramedics. A client's health status is tracked by internal cyberware, and if a client takes a turn for the worse, an AV squad receives their GPS signal and arrives on the scene in minutes. Reaction time and additional perks are dependent on the client's insurance package.
Inpatient careguarantees that every Trauma Team branch clinic is equipped with surgical nannites, specialized antibodies, and cryogenic chambers. Trauma Team also offers their own medications and reanimators, and has a selection of surplus implants from their suppliers.
Trauma Team's premium insurance packages are divided into three grades: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The Platinum package is the most comprehensive and expensive option. It includes 24/7 monitoring, emergency patient transport, surgery and nano surgery, post-trauma rehabilitation, plastic surgery on demand, free check ups with the client's ripperdoc, and up to 90% discount on prescriptions, and a 3-minute response time. Gold and Silver packages are cheaper, but include fewer perks.
Clients can subscribe to one of Trauma Team's premium packages for as little as 24 hours if they cannot afford longer-term coverage.
Each Trauma Team squad consists of:
Each trauma team squad has their own TTI Medical AV-4A, a light-weight Aerodyne made of composite materials. The pilot mans the AV-4A, while the co-pilot mans the vehicle's front-mounted gatling gun. The pilot and co-pilot do not leave the Aerodyne during patient extraction, and their cockpit is kept separate from the rest of the vehicle.
During flight, two Security Specialists sit in the same compartment as the EMTs. The security specialists sit directly behind the pilot and co-pilot, and each of them mans a 7.62 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) machine-gun mounted to their side of the vehicle. The EMTs sit toward the back of the vehicle, with the Lead EMT sitting next to the patient stretcher and the Assistant EMT sitting next to the medical supplies.
During patient extraction, the two EMTs and two Security Specialists disembark from the AV-4A and make their way to the patient to rescue them. If necessary, the two Security Specialists will clear a path to the patient for the EMTs using their rifles and submachine guns. Each EMT is armed with a pistol for self-protection.

Once a relatively small company based out of Cupertino,California, Zetatech had always maintained its strong presence inNight City. Specializing in computer hardware, software, and wetware design, the company was among the main providers of neural processors, microchips, and robotics on the American market. By2013and2020, their products included everything fromcyberware, tocyberdecks, to computers. After theFourth Corporate War, the corporation expanded due to the lucrative government contracts during theTime of the Redin the Rebuilding era. Since2045, Zetatech has diversified their product range, continuing in cyberware and computer systems, but also investing heavily into avionics research and manufacturing to become one of the major players in the transportation sector. Theiraerodynegunships and security, combat, and utilitydronesare currently their most recognizable products, used widely by all megacorporations.[2]
Zetatech started as a new high-tech company doing its best to grow and diversify in Cupertino, California. It carved itself a small niche in the industry through the traditional espionage, and strategically applied violence. Having made it over the first hurdle, Zetatech attempted to build a heavy name for itself by expanding overseas, the assured toward success, and a high inflow of stableEurodollars. This meant encroaching on markets occupied by other companies, most of which were not inclined to share their profits.[3][4]
During theFirst Corporate War, Zetatech was aligned withOrbital Air, and waged a large-scaleNet-based attack onEuro Business Machines(EBM). EBM was able to repel the attack and knock Zetatech out of the war in October of2004.[5]
In the wake of the Fourth Corporate War, though still considered a second tier corp[6], Zetatech found itself in an advantageous position to expand. Many rival corporations were weakened or out of business as a result of the war, and Zetatech moved to snatch up many government contracts during the Rebuilding era.[2]It emerged as a household name for economy 3D printers[7]and overtookSegotarias a world leader in the production ofAgents[8], with itsGrade Aseries being one of the most ubiquitous Agent models anywhere.[9]Most significantly, Zetatech developed as a major name in the transportation sector, producing economical and sturdy aerial vehicles such as theZetatech AeroVox,Destination, andHerakles.[10][11][12]
By2077, Zetatech was a world leader in the manufacture of cyberware equipment and aerial transportation, producing high quality products for every budget. It was also a major shipping enterprise. Among its best-selling products were theZetatech Atlus, its flagship product used byTrauma TeamandN54 News, theZetatech Surveyor, used by organizations likeKang TaoandMaxTac, and theSigma K.54cyberarm.
Their NC headquarters was located in the Zetatech Building on Berkeley Avenue.[1]
In2079, Zetatech had greatly expanded its influence. It had achieved over 80% domination of the North American market, and claimed to have completely eliminated cyberpsychosis in its latest cyberware thanks to a revolutionary new immune system booster that greatly reduced the number of negative immune responses in implants. Zetatech had a record breaking year in 2078, and expected to break it again in 2079. They had grown their holdings to include two additional offices inWatsonandWestbrook.
According to theNC Inquirer, Zetatech's recent dominance came from ongoing secret tests and a discrete agreement with city leaders.[1][13]
As of 2020, threeAV-4assault vehicles, three helicopters, one private jet based out of San Francisco International Airport. Each office has an emergency first aid infirmary, but only the San Francisco office has a surgery capable trauma center. The military hardware available to Zetatech is only of moderate power. High-tech personal arms, armor and vehicular weapons systems are readily available, but only limited amounts of heavier weapons are available, and usually they can not be obtained on short notice. Zetatech has no airlift capability of its own, but could arrange access to heavy lifting aircraft given enough time.[4][3]

Night Corporation[3](commonly stylized asNight Corp) is a development firm and public works corporationheadquarteredinNight City. Originally founded byRichard Nightas a development firm known asNight International,[1][4]it was later restructured intoNight's Foundationby Richard's wife and widowMiriam Night, and later again into Night Corp.[2]
Night Corp is a unique enterprise that puts its full attention onNight Cityand its affairs, inspired by the ideals of the city's founder,Richard Night, and his wifeMiriam. By adhering to their founders' vision, the company aims to improve the living standards of all Night Citizens, putting the metropolis' welfare first and foremost.
Night Corp is development firm and public works corporation that acts as the largest contractor of public procurements within Night City's boundaries, building and renovating facilities such as roads, bridges, tunnels, metro lines, power plants,nettransmitters, waterworks, sewerage, among others. The corporation is also known for their charities designed to aid the poor children of Night City, scholarship programs to benefit gifted youth —Jefferson Peralez, futureMayor of Night City, was among them — or donations to the various city orphanages. Night Corp is also heavily invested in research for ecology and alternate power sources, as well as other developments involving avant-garde technology, financing multiple local projects in the process. They also posses orbital stations and satellites aroundEarth.[2][5]
Due to the corporation's seclusive and often downright secretive policies, not much is publicly known about Night Corp, sparking many rumors about their operations, which supposedly include underwater works inDel Coronado Bay, secretive engagements in mayoral elections, or shares in their orbital projects. Night Corp security is tight, and most corporations prefer to not mess with them in their own territory.[2]
The company'sheadquartersare located in theCity Centerdistrict of Night City.[6]
Richard Night, a successful businessman who during the early1990swas concerned by the violence and disruption of the impendingUnited StatesCollapse, saw himself in an unique position to deal with the forthcoming issue. Working mainly on corporate-funded projects under a notorious company known asHalsey, Ferris and Night, Richard was dreaming to create his own ideal city. For that reason, he decided to depart and start his own development firm, Night International, and began to plan his utopian dream ofCoronado City, an exemplary metropolis that was to be completely self-sufficient and capable of holding off even the most determined criminals. It would boast planned neighborhoods dedicated to preserving the feel of different types of nationalities and cultures, as well as a super-modern corporate center that would stand as a shining beacon of enlightened capitalism. By1992, Night had managed to secure the unheard-of amount of capital needed to finance such a large-scale enterprise.Arasaka,EBMandPetrochemhad all signed on with the project spearheaded by Night International, leading to the formation of theCoronado Partnership. Not long afterMA&Fwould also join them as one of the major bankrollers.
After rearranging the terrain, Coronado City was finally founded in1994at the former site ofMorro Bay. Night International had the capacity to start construction, but a project of such scale needed more companies to provide much of the needed workforce, machinery and materials, eventually lending to the unwarranted employment of theMob, who controlled most of the construction companies in the West Coast. However, Night's plan required the use his own advanced building techniques and materials that Night International was capable of, but which excluded a number of established unions and construction firms controlled by his new partners. This displeased them, and Night's further insistence that his new city would be safe and crime free angered them even more. Over the following years though construction of Coronado City advanced positively, the furious mobs finally had enough of the entrepreneur's ideas and his luck ran out. On September 20th1998, Richard Night was shot and murdered in his penthouse suite at the top of the newly constructedParkview Tower. Night's killer was never apprehended, and in his memory, the newly appointedCity Councilofficially renamed Coronado City as "Night City" in his honor.[7][8][4][2]
A year after her husband's death, in1999,Miriam Nightrestructured Richard's company and founded Night's Foundation, with the primary goal to protect and promote her husband's vision of the perfect city.[2]However, in the following decade Night's Foundation struggled to keep the welfare of Night City, which soon fell into chaos as the Mob and gangs took over. During the infamousMob Warset between2009and2011, the foundation attempted to gain megacorporate support to end the reign of crime in the city, but to no avail. Allegedly, after the conflict Miriam realized that to have any power in the city, you had to play by the rules of the big businesses to get ahead. As such, Night's Foundation was restructured, returning to its corporate roots, and renamed to Night Corporation — Night Corp for short. Ever since, the company remained a constant presence in Night City, expanding their field of activity but avoiding power struggles with other major corporations. Although Miriam would eventually step down from the role of CEO during the following years, her legacy and ideals were always upheld by her successors.[2][6][1]
During theFourth Corporate War, especially after theNight City Holocaustof2023, Night Corp constructed a number of soup station operations throughout the ruined city to aid those who needed it the most. However, once the war had finished in2025, this only lasted for a few more months before Night Corp decided their funds were better spent elsewhere.[9]
Night Corporation would become more notorious during the rebuilding years of the metropolis. They were a major reason as to why thenomadstraveled to Night City to help, as well as one of the instigators for the local squabbling factions controlling the city to cooperate and form a new government. The company offered generous pay and freecyberwareand biomonitor upgrades to anyone willing to help clean up the crater of radioactive rubble atground zero. Both Night Corp and theCity Councilclaimed that casualties were kept to a minimum, while at the same time they did not provide official statistics to substantiate said claim. Nevertheless, they were never under pressure to release such documents since most rescue, engineering, and rubble cleanup teams were not local Night Citizens, but nomads — especially from theAldecaldosnation.[10][6][4]
During these years, Night Corp and the City Council gave a grant and buy-in to the recently foundedZigguratcorporation in order to help them transform the old fiber-opticData Termnetwork into a new system — creating one of the firstCitiNetsandData Poolsin the world — and restore cheap and reliable communication across the metropolis.[8]
By the early-mid2040s, Night Corp was investing a large portion of their resources in the reconstruction of Night City, which included an upgrade to thepolice headquartersinthe Glen. Although they were doing this by transferring the resources destined for the neighborhoods that needed it the most, likeSouth Night City, to more wealthier areas.[9]The corp was the one who appointedZohara Freemanas the city manager for the Glen.[11]
In2045,Orbital Airwas tasked to construct amass driverin Night City, but the project was abandoned and instead theNCX Spaceportwas built. Night Corp, who had frequently collaborated with OA in the past, was furious with this outcome as the city lost its chance to become a "frontier to conquer space." This caused Night Corp to cut all ties with Orbital Air, starting a sort of cold war between them.[12]
At some point since Night City's reconstruction, theoil fieldsnorth of the city became a joint project ofPetrochemand Night Corp.[13]
In2068,NCARTwas bought out by Night Corp after an incident in which unknown attackers released poison gas in the subway stations across Night City, leading to prolonged riots and NCART's bankruptcy. Ever since, this public transit system was considered to have become more reliable.[6][14]
Due to the much less competent leadership figures in Night Corp, by the2070sthe company had lost the race against major corporations such asArasakaandMilitech, both of whom came to wield the most power in Night City. With the metropolis reconstruction era behind them, Night Corp's glory days were over, and the company's influence was waning quickly. Still, in spite of how they managed their resources, Night Corp's leadership kept a significant say in the matters pertaining to the public administration and social issues in NC. They were involved in many of the city's projects, essentially running much of the local infrastructure, and were known to fund local organizations such as theNCPDandMaxTac, though every passing day their coffers kept shrinking. Nevertheless, a number of Night Corp employees did not lose faith in the city's founder vision, and due to the corp's merited history throughout the years, some residents expressed their wishes for the corporation to return into a position of true power.[3][6]Moreover, due to Orbital Air's neglect in maintaining the spaceport, there were those wondering if Night Corp would try to push OA out of Night City.[15]
By2076, Night Corp was beginning to turn their luck. Their public image was good, though not much was known about their operations due to the company's secretive nature. Even its employees knew only as much as they needed to do their jobs and little more. This caused a number of conspiracy theories surrounding the corporation, though this didn't deter them from their objective. One of the biggest projects they had recently acquired was the revitalization of the Night City portion of the old transcontinentalmaglev system, which they were hoping would connect the newCorporate Plazawith the continent's East Coast.[16][6]Night Corp was also sponsoring theNight City Corsairsfootball team, giving them exclusive rights tocyberwareequipment designed in the company's top-secret "Football Science Lab" to give them the upper hand against the competition.[17]
In early2077, Night Corp's labor was recognized when it was nominated as the fifth biggest and best corporation to work for in Night City. Despite not being able to compete against the largest powers, they had managed to enter the top five after announcing a reduction of the mandatory workweek hours to 80.[18]The corporation had also finalized their conceptual engineering efforts to revitalize the local intercontinental maglev system, and were starting to repair sections of the old network, as well as drilling a new tunnel beneath the city foundations from aconstruction sitein theBadlandsto the north east. Construction was expected to finish in2078, with the first connections operational by the end of said year, and with the city ofChicagoby2080.[16]
Around early-mid 2077,Sandra Dorsett— an employee of the corporation — stole information from Night Corp on adatabank, which was something Sandra wished to expose to the public. The databank itself contained the information on tests the corporation had conducted using anAIto condition its own employees. The AI was designed to control not just their workers, but other figures Night Corp deemed useful to them.[19]

Maelstrom's territory was in the industrial part ofWatson. Deeply obsessed with cybertechnology, their urge to improve the weakness of their own human flesh was far stronger than their fear of cyberpsychosis.[X 1]
The gang's philosophy was dictated by their obsession to improve the "weak flesh" and install lots of cyberware, as well as a fascination with the occult and the pursuit of any otherworldly sensations. Outsiders believed these ideals were connected, as many thought over-augmentation could lead to cyberpsychosis and other mental disorders, though this didn't seem to bother Maelstrom, as they clearly enjoyed sliding on the edge of madness. Cyberware used by them include pain editors, cyberoptics, and reflex boosters.[1]
They partitioned their organization into smaller groups, each responsible for a different part of their criminal empire. Depending on the task, these groups could be as small as four or five if patrolling their own turf, or large as thirty members to partake in raids, hit jobs, or protecting valuable cargo.[1]
The main revenue stream for Maelstromers came from smuggling illegal meds and drugs. They also performed hit jobs, which they executed in a bizarre and brutal fashion. Many victims were found dismembered, skinned alive, or drowned in wet concrete. They also performed well planned and executed heists on heavily-guarded corporate transports.
Another prominent source of income was theTotentanzclub, the most popular gangster club and "drink&riot" venue inNight Cityat the that time. Totentanz was located in an abandoned hotel where other gangers went to party and listen to neo-death metal music as long as they obeyed Maelstrom's authority and customs. If a night at TTC had a body count less than a dozen it was considered crappy and boring.
Rumors said that the gang was involved in the production of black marketbraindancerecords; especially bizarre, disturbing, and extremely violent ones. Other rumors stated they produced a BD called "Numbness," an emotional void that placed users in a strange state of mind, which was quite popular among overstimulated BD users. Despite these rumors, theNCPDdidn't find evidence to prove Maelstrom was involved in the BD black market.[1]
Formed inNight Cityat some point after2013, Maelstrom was established by a former member of theMetal Warriorscombat gangknown asHammer, who was thrown out for breaking the gang's combat code. At some point later, the Warriors were almost completely wiped out by theInquisitorsgang during a nightly brawl, and the surviving members drifted apart, with one part of the remnants joining Hammer to form Maelstrom. Over time, they also acquired people from theRed Chrome Legionand theIron Sightsthat had a personal grudge against the Inquisitors, though other targets were randomly salvaged as well. Maelstrom's symbol was a fist clenched around the handle of an old-style hammer surrounded by a whirlwind. Its members appeared to look dirty, primitive, and dangerous, wearing traditional black leather and chrome chains while sporting visiblecyberware. Led by Hammer, Maelstrom didn't have any codes, everything was permitted. About 1/3 of the gang were registeredcyberpsychos, while the rest were hovering near the edge. Only if you encountered the Inquisitors were you glad to see the Maelstrom colors. Otherwise you wouldn't be as appreciative.
In the late2010s, Maelstrom decided to settle down, establishing a hideout for the gang in a former department store inOld Downtownknown asBarley's, not far from the docks. They made the area surrounding this building their territory, but the situation was volatile at best due to the large number of close businesses servicingcorporatesandsolos. Maelstrom was smart enough to realize this, and chose their targets very carefully, though for some reason they never bothered the three elderly ladies of a nearby unguardedflower shop.
By2020, other than nighttime sweeps for Inquisitors, Maelstrom did small-time crimes and protection rackets, but the need for new cyberware and combat drugs drove them to assault larger targets likeGuevarra's, a restaurant in the neighborhood that sold weapons out of a back alley. Attacking this place would erupt into a bloodbath, pinning cyberpsychos against professionals. Maelstrom was also notorious for "laundering" miscreants, a discipline applied by throwing them off the rooftop atTong Laundrys.[2]
TheFourth Corporate Warhad a devastating effect on Maelstrom. During theNight City Holocaustof2023, their hideout was lucky enough to be shielded from the bomb by theBayview Condosbuilding, but most of the heavily cybered members died in a weird, EMP induced, frenzy of hyper-violence right after the explosion, including Hammer. Despite their neighborhood surviving the nuke, the following raging fires swept over their territory, brining everything down. Multiple Maelstromers were burned by the flames. With Hammer gone,Crusherbecame the new leader. He rallied the survivors to fight through the wreckage of the burning city, and led them to what they considered their second home, theTotentanzclub on the top floors ofBurleson Tower. Once they reached the damaged hotel, they found out that theWarrior Heartgang had had the same idea. A battle to control the ruined building ensued, with Crusher killing the Warrior Heart's leader, and later Maelstrom presumably exterminating the rest of the gang. Afterwards, Maelstrom stabilized the damaged structure by using rubble and salvaged construction gear, and declared Burleson their new base of operations, occupying the middle floors of the hotel. Soon after, they recovered the charred mummified corpses of their former comrades, including Hammer's, and displayed them on one of the walls in the hotel's ballroom, which they also used to hold court. It was considered a mark of honor to wear the old chrome of their fallen members, which had visible scarred damage.[3]
Over the following years, Maelstrom repaired parts of Burleson Tower and reopened the Totentanz. They also repelled looters, end-of-the-world types, and even soldiers from various sides, all while rebuilding their group by incorporating cast-offs and other gang survivors, especially from the remnants of dozens of high-chromed gangs, often after defeating them in battle before inducting the survivors. Among these wasWarlock, a young kid who had joined them during the chaos of the smoldering city.[3][4]At some point after the war, Maelstrom settled a long running feud with a smaller gang of cyberpsychos and began adopting some of their old rival's meat-heating philosophies, leading to an almost exponential increase in visible and extreme cyberware among gang members. This, in turn, increased the number and intensity of the fights between Maelstrom and the Inquisitors.[5]
Crusher kept a strong leadership during those trying times, often leading the charge against Maelstrom enemies. However, something broke inside of Crusher the day the city burned, and in2027, during a cyberpsychotic episode, he slaughtered aStormTechconvoy and disappeared into theHot Zone. He was replaced byHextra.[3]
During the2030s, Maelstrom grew their influence in the Hot Zone and central Night City, although at some point Hextra was killed byMAX-TAC. With her gone, the young Warlock took the reigns, withQuakeandFlenserbacking him up. Warlock had learned from the best, including the previous leaders. He organized the wannabes who hanged around the hotel and turned them into one of the best scavenger forces working inside the Hot Zone; hordes of people willing to get cancer for an opportunity to become a Malestromer or gain some shiny chrome. In time, Maelstrom even began leading other gangs in salvaging valuable gear from there as well. Warlock also consolidated the gang's grasp on Totentanz, and while other booster gangs were welcome, it was Maelstrom who kept the building standing. On the other hand, Warlock's lieutenants were essential for his rule. Quake's modus-operandi of brutality, and his black leathers and red lights inspired the new recruits, while Flenser made sure the gang took all advantages ofnetrunning. Another essential member wasJoe Pitt, who maintained most of the HQ's structure, weaponry and equipment; andRipper, who organized and oversaw the scavenging efforts in the Hot Zone.
By the2040s, Maelstrom was growing in power through a flourishing drug and cybernetic trade. Warlock had forged the gang's best and most ruthless members into a productive core that run its businesses while he used its rank and file to wreck competitors. Despite his typical ganger looks, Warlock drove his agenda with ease, obtaining deals even withcorporateagents, while the rest of his gang built Maelstrom's reputation for messy hyperviolence and creepy rituals; these last ones developed by Ripper and Quake, though some of the members truly believed in them. Warlock purposefully made the gang look chaotic from the outside to hide how his core teams operated methodically, enacting his long-term plans. Maelstrom controlled a drug-trafficking network, which also moved reclaimed weapons and technology. Their operations within the Hot Zone were successful, salvaging valuable equipment of all kinds, especially cyberware. With this, they had deals with many ripperdocs across Night City, trading cheap parts for discounted services. While the rank and file worked the gang's drugs and cyberware trade, Warlock had long-term ambitions for Maelstrom. For starters, he was planning to search for a permanent home for the gang and Totentanz that wasn't an old building that was falling apart, though there were more immediate priorities first. By how they had been doing things, they stood to gain a real piece of the city's underworld. Even while working many projects simultaneously, Maelstrom still had time to set aside any work in order to stomp any Inquisitors they came across, fueling decades of bad blood on both sides.[3]
On January 23 of2044, a group of squatters living in what was left of the oldBrookhaven Co-opapartments was being thrashed by Maelstrom to keep working for Ripper, the infamous Hot Zone overseer. Since most were veterans and peripherals, the nearbyForlorn Hopestaff and patrons decided to help them, fighting off the Maelstromers long enough for the squatters to leave town with theJodes. In the process, the Hope's people rescued a street kid namedValence, taking them in as one of their own. This act of kindness infuriated Ripper, who was running the salvaging operations by using desperate people.[4]
By2045, and due to the poor state of Burleson Tower, it was a matter of time before the building collapsed on top of the Maelstromers and their guests. To avoid that, Warlock tasked Flenser, who sent people to find a new place for gang. She had a list with some locations in theWatson Development, though she was preferably looking for another hotel.[6][3]At the same time, Maelstrom was looking to expand their operations in the city, choosingOld Japantownas their next target. This, however, caused them to clash with the localTyger Claws.[3]
The successful operations for the gang within the Hot Zone pushed manyscavvergroups to take bolder and more violent actions in the variouscombat zonesaround the city. While this was happening, Warlock began to maintain a close eye on Ripper, as he had heard rumors that Ripper could try to break away and form his own gang with the scavengers they forced to dig out all the valuable tech. Warlock's worries, however, were quelled when a group ofmercenarieshired by the owners of the newForlorn Hopeended Ripper's career. As it turned out, the underboss had claimed his vendetta for the escaped squatters by destroying the oldForlorn Hopebar inLittle China, though the owners survived and were seeking retribution ever since. Ripper was either killed by the mercs,Rocklin Augmentics, or Maelstrom itself after discovering either Ripper's and Rocklin's deals, bringing the corps wrath too close to the gang, or by finding out how much of acyberpsychoticmonster he really was. No matter the outcome, Maelstrom lost their scavenging efforts overseer.[4]This, however, didn't stop the ongoing operations the gang had in the Hot Zone, with the ruinedAshcroft Hotelas their logistics center.[7]
At some point, Maelstrom found a new location for their gang and a newTotentanzwas opened in an abandoned under-construction hotel in the northern neighborhoods of the city.[8]
By the2070s, Maelstrom was a dangerous, violent boostergang who lived their lives by the concept that metal was better than meat. No one joined them without undergoing an extensive cyberware implantation that not only changed their looks to appear less human and more machine-like, but also enhanced their bodies. Their obsession with chrome was tied to an almost obscure reverence for their gang rituals as they blended in other-worldly superstitions. Despite their members closing in on the edge of cyberpsychosis, Maelstrom had been proving for the last decades how canny they were by building a criminal empire based on smuggling, black market technology, and drug dealing. They controlled much of theNorthside Industrial DistrictinWatson, but their influence extended further south.[9]
By2077, they were led byRoyceafter he deposed and imprisoned the last boss,Brick.[10]
These are the stats and equipment of an average Maelstromer member in 2020'sNight City Sourcebook.

TheValentinosare agangoperating inNight City.
During the2070s, the Valentinos were based out ofHeywoodin centralNight City. They were one of the largest gangs in the metropolis, with a membership of about 6,000 in2077. Strictly territorial, they operated in the vast impoverished Latino barrios inthe Glen,Vista del Rey, andWellsprings, where they were strongly rooted in the local communities. They were representatives of the Chicano culture of Night City and had cultivated those traditions for more than a century.
Valentinos openly displayed their gang tattoos and gold jewelry with religious motifs. The most common patrons were theSanta MuerteandJesús Malverde. The first being seen as a symbol for aholy deathand the latter as an honorable thief who was said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. They also had a taste for colorful clothes, pimped out lowriders, and silver and gold-plated guns.Cyberwareused by the gang included reflex boosters, autoloaders, and augmented cyberlimbs.[1]
The majority of Valentino members were ofMexicanheritage, but other ethnic groups and people with different background were welcome to join. Members tended to integrate quickly, adopting Chicano culture and celebrating various Mexican holidays and customs likeDia de Los Muertos,Quinceañeras,Semana Santa, orDia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe.
This sense of common heritage or at least shared customs binded the gang with the local people to form one big family. The community's loyalty protected the gang members, which madeNCPDand corporate infiltrations into the gang almost impossible. In return, the Valentinos protected the whole neighborhood. It wass for these reasons that betraying one's gang was seen as the most heinous crime a Valentino could commit, and was usually punished with a particularly gruesome death.
On the other hand, Valentinos who died fighting other gangs, police, or corporate enforcers were often remembered as saints and martyrs. These people were commemorated in songs and depicted on giant murals. This memorial street art functioned as religious iconography and often incorporated written descriptions of the saint'sgloriousdeeds.[1]
The Valentinos owned many legitimate businesses such as restaurants, auto shops, local construction companies, and nightclubs, but also operatedbraindancerecording studios, and sports-betting parlors. The legal businesses often served as a front for criminal activity: as meeting places, money-laundering operations, or illegal chop shops for stolen vehicles.
Their main sources of income were gun smuggling, car theft, drug trafficking, robbery, burglary, hit jobs (including assault or murder), prostitution, and illegal modification of weapons and vehicles.[1]
During the late2030s,La LloronaandEl Sombreronbecame the butchers of a group known as the Valentinos, ending the life of any enemy of theirs. They made a name for themselves inNight City, half fearing them and the other half wanting them dead. Around the mid2040s, La Llorona faked her death during a mission and escaped the city with a new identity, while El Sombreron stayed, eventually becoming a notorious member of the organization.[2]
At some point during or prior the2060s, the Valentinos were considered a small predominately Latino cartel operating in Night City. During this time, there was a bloodbath inMoto Cieloin which many Valentinos died.Sebastian Ibarra, a Valentino priest, survived the ordeal and found what he considered a noble calling, becoming afixerof Night City, eventually gaining the nickname of Padre.[3]
By the2070s, the Valentinos were one of Night City's largest gangs and were bound by a strong moral code and century-old traditions of the Catholic god and protecting their peers. This protection did not cover any one ethnic or religious group, but instead those that grew up inHeywoodalongside them. The Valentinos treated values such as honor, justice, and brotherhood with deadly seriousness,[R 1][1]and were usually neutral to any strangers as long as they didn't cause any trouble, even helping tourists that had gotten lost by directing them back toCity Center.[1]During those years there were also rumors the Valentinos had somehow evolved from anancient clubof Lotharios who competed against each other in acts of seduction, but no modern gang member ever confirmed that. As far as they were concerned, they had always been what they were, similar to how Heywood had always been the land beneath their feet.[4]Between parties, parades, drag races and excessive drinking, they hanged around the barrio under the watchful eyes ofSanta Muerte.
In2071, the Valentinos and6th Streethad been in turf war for some time, with their latest conflict during that year being a firefight inWestbrook.[5]At some point prior or during2074, the Valentinos and 6th Street would escalate their turf war over the control ofVista del Rey, which caused many of the sub-district residents to move to more secure places.[1]
By2077, the war between the Valentinos and 6th Street was intensifying, with Vista del Rey being more dangerous than ever.[6]That same year, a troublesome gang member known asJosé Luiswas contracted byArasakain an attempt to frameMilitechfor assaulting an Arasaka facility, but his operations were stopped by Heywood fixer and respected former Valentino Sebastian Ibarra.[7]The gang's main leader,Campo Orta, still had four more years to spend in prison.[8]

TheVoodoo Boys(real name unknown) are agangoperating inNight City.
What in the 2070s was known as the Voodoo Boys originate fromHaiti.
In2062, climate change wiped Haiti off the face of the earth. Many refugees moved to Night City to work in the construction project of turningPacificainto a resort city. A project that eventually collapsed. The Haitians remained there and were labeled as Voodoo Boys by the locals, who thought the Haitians had some resemblance to thedefunct gang.[2][3]The new Voodoo Boys became the self-appointed guardians of Haitian refugees' interests and safety in the Pacifica. They also began probing theBlackwallin hope of making contact with rogueAIsbeyond the barrier.
Although known by outsiders as the Voodoo Boys, the real name they use for the gang is unknown.[4]
By2077, the Voodoo Boys had become an enigmatic gang fromPacifica, made up ofNetrunnersdevoted to uncovering the secrets of theOld Netand what was behind theBlackwall. They were also Edgerunners: breaking every rule there was to break, and programming viruses that could freeze neural networks.[5]
The Voodoo Boys appeared to outsiders as an exclusively Haitian gang, heavily involved with the larger Haitian community in Pacifica, which had continued to grow since the arrival of refugees fleeing the natural disasters that destroyed their country in the 2060s. The gang was led byBrigitteand her second-in-command,Placide, and had formed a rivalry with aBoostergangknown as theAnimals.
There was also a schism between Brigitte andWilky LaGuerre, with the latter moving intoDogtownwith his people. This fragmentation was based on the fact that Brigitte wanted to pierce through theBlackwall, while Slider considered it too dangerous.[6]
Depending on the actions chosen duringI Walk the LineandTransmission, the Voodoo Boys in Pacifica can either be wiped out, or would have traveled beyond the Blackwall with the aid ofAlt Cunningham, disappearing from public view.[7]
A mysterious gang from Pacifica with a dark reputation for their netrunning skills and their mystical voodoo flavor. Presumed to be entirely consist of members withHaitianblood, the Voodoo Boys are exclusive, secretive, and distrustful of outsiders. The gang was originally comprised of voodoo priests and priestesses, the prominent caste in the Creole culture of the Haitian diaspora. In 2062, climate change wiped Haiti off the face of the earth and initiated a new chapter of the Voodoo Boys' history. The gang became the self-appointed guardians of Haitian refugees' interests and safety in the Pacifica combat zone.
Most Voodoo Boys are Netrunners, so cooling suits and neural implants are common elements of a member's outfit complemented with "voodoo-flavored" elements like dreadlocks, tattoos, and the bones and skulls of small birds and rodents worn as charms.Cyberwareused by the gang include cyberdecks and neural links.[1]
Due to the homogenous nature of the Creole diaspora in the Pacifica, coupled with the lack ofpolice forcesin the district, it is difficult to determine the Voodoo Boys' numbers, structure, or even goals. It is widely known that the gang is determined to uncover the secrets of theOld Net, and it's commonly believed that they probe theBlackwallin hope of making contact the rogue intelligent systems beyond the barrier. These attempts have drawn the attention and enmity ofNetWatch, who are interested in tracking and dispatching rogue netrunners and self aware ISs.
The gang's primary source of income involves hacking databanks and accounts within various corporations in search of restricted and top-secret data. They persistently violate NetWatch laws and regulations, especially in regard to contact with ISs. The Voodoo Boys also hire themselves out as mercenary netrunners for private contractors who are interested in hit-and-run netrunning operations or exploring any ruined parts of the Old Net.
Other sources of income are hard to verify, but theft of virtual currency and information brokering are probably among them.[1]

TheAnimalsare agangoperating inNight City.
During the2070s, the Animals were an aggressive street-fighting gang without permanent turf inNight City, but who put emphasis on physical power above all else. They were known for eschewing traditionalcyberwarein favor custom-brewed body enchantments such as ultra-testosterone and animal supplements (including equine growth hormones) in order to make themselves bigger and stronger. Despite being considered purists by some, they were not against using a number of body-enhancing implants like pain editors, subdermal armors, combat drug injectors, or augmentedcyberlimbs. If someone looked like their muscles were so large that they were about to burst, they were probably an Animal. Their most used beverage was a notorious steroid-like drug known as the "Juice," which increased the user's strength, size and speed, but caused several health risk problems. The Animals were a gang that focused on achieving peak human strength, and for them, the term "concrete jungle" was literal in that they respected brawniness and ability above all else.[1][2][3]
Experienced brawlers and trained in various forms of martial arts, Animals were keen on cage fights, duels, and other displays of brute physical force. They frequently sold off their services as bouncers and bodyguards, jobs for which they were heavily sought after, and were spread throughout Night City. Its members typically wore tattoos and hooligan hoods as well as some artificial animalistic features ranging from purely cosmetic changes like spotted or stripped skin and subdermal implants, to extreme plastic surgery and cybernetic modifications like bestial jaws, and vat-grown implanted muscles. Some Animal members were known for theirexotics.[1][2]
The Animals were fascinated with the feral, primal side of human nature. They viewed this aspect as the border between man and animal, and were each on a personal quest to establish themselves as a new dominant human subspecies. To achieve this, they constantly subjected themselves to brutal and violent tests of skill. They would often take on dangerous cyber-implanted opponents to prove they were better, not matter if they were from other dangerous gangs, theNCPD, or corporate forces. They trained in fighting sports not for philosophical reasons but to sharpen their effectiveness in combat.
Internal gang relations were equally animalistic. On their own impermanent turf, Animals were divided into small "packs" led by the biggest and strongest member, the alpha male or female. Disputes were often solved with trial by combat, which was fought until one side completely submitted.[1]
Animals were mostly known for their ultraviolent raids on residential districts and other gangs' home turf. They also organized illegal underground fights and manufactured and sold drugs, mostly custom brew anabolic steroids. A few packs specialized in raiding drug stores, chemical transport, pharmaceutical companies, and drug dealers. Some hired themselves out as bodyguards or bouncers for a large number of businesses such as brothels, strip clubs, corporations, and more. Some were even racketeers who specialized in extortion and assault.[1]
In2077,Sasquatchand her pack were hired byNetWatchto guard their operations in theGrand Imperial Mallof thePacificacombat zone. NetWatch's objective was to stop the localVoodoo Boysfrom interacting with theBlackwall, and employed the Animals to protect them and hide their presence from any intruders that accessed the mall.[4]
Instead of a single leader, the Animals are divided between a number of packs, each with a single alpha acting as the Pack Leader.

TheTyger Claws(虎鉤衆) are agangoperating inNight City.
During the2070s, the Tyger Claws were ruthless territorial gang based inJapantown. They were one of the largest gangs inNight Citywith a number of approximately 5,500 members in2077. Tyger foot soldiers were easily recognized by their Asian luminous tattoos, fast street bikes, katanas, and tantos.Cyberwareused by the gang included reflex boosters, augmented cyberlimbs, pain editors, and electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems disguised as tattoos.[1]
The business strategy of the Tyger Claws was similar to theYakuza. Crossing the lowest level member could cause a quick and violent reaction from the entire gang, but if they got what they wanted, everything should be fine.
The top brass of the Claws believed business was preferable to war in the long run, but many of the rank-and-file gangers were sadistic brutes prone to violence. Abduction, torture, sexual assault, and cruel or unusual killings were just a few examples of their depravity. It was not uncommon for young, brash, or drunk Tygers to undermine the gang's ideologies by abusing their status on their turf, harassing outsiders, and provoking fights. This behavior was considered dishonorable by their crime bosses, but an outsider reacting to ganger's behavior in kind would rarely go unpunished.
Most people outside of the gang's ranks who were provoked, wisely avoided direct confrontation with Tygers - unless they had connections with high-ranking members of the gang.[1]
Japantown was Night City's lead nightlife district and the Tygers controled a significant portion of it. They owned more businesses in Night City than any other gang: bars, restaurants,braindanceclubs, brothels, and casinos. Many of these businesses were registered as legal businesses, but acted as fronts for illegal operations and money laundering.
The gang made most of its money from human trafficking and prostitution. The Tyger Claws also made money from manufacturing and distributing drugs, most notably "glitter". Tygers also hired themselves out for hit jobs.
The gang also had corporate connections who visited their establishments to blow off steam and have fun. The Claws had especially close ties toArasakaupper management, who outsourced them side-jobs, paying them with cybertechnology and military-grade automatic weapons.[1]
The Tyger's Claw begun as anArasaka-backed motorcycle club. By2020, they had grown into a smallcombat gangwho claimed turf in the originalJapantownand the residential community surrounding it. Occasionally, they protected the localJapanesepopulation at large thanks to the Arasaka financing. Its members used enhanced reflex boosterscyberwareand martials arts as their preferred weapons of choice.[2][3]
After theNight City Holocaustof2023, the tattered remains of the Tyger's Claw, who had been used as a proxy gang by Arasaka, were left to their own devices after the megacorp was kicked out from North America. Fortunately for its members, they were soon contacted by theNight City Co-Prosperity Sphere(NCCS) — a recently formed conglomerate of Japanese-based corps — and were led to what would be known as theWatson Developmentin the north ofNight City. There, the NCCS, led by famous actorShinobu Nakagawa, reformed them into aguardian gangknown as the Tyger Claws, with the main objective of protecting the local Japanese communities in the city. To accomplish this goal, the Claws formed a sub-group known as theKimen-Gumi, who would become the public face of the gang that everyone knew about, being recognized to operate as a legal entity. This group had security contracts, and often deputized themselves as law enforcement in specific parts of the city, even collaborating with theNCPDon occasions.
Ever since Arasaka was spelled from the continent, plenty of spies who stayed behind became sleeper agents, integrating within the local communities while awaiting orders from the corporation. Many of them joined the Tyger Claws, working for the gang while conducting undercover operations for Arasaka.[4]
Over the following years, the Tyger Claws, and especially the Kimen-Gumi, grew in popularity aroundKabuki, where the gang had set their new headquarters in theNakagawa Kabuki Theater, though they also had a base of operations inOld Japantownas well, where they had worked to rebuild some sections of their former home. While the Kimen-Gumi provided a good publicity for the gang, beneath the surface the Claws took their cut from their sub-group's public activities, often insisting on protection fees. They also gained money from various activates around their territory,Night Marketsales or pachinko parlor receipts. The Claws intentionally left the NCCS alone, as they were one of the gang's major sponsors. One notable member who had recently joined wasHayato Nakagawa, the adoptive son of Shinobu Nakagawa. He had talent as agangsterand quickly rose over the ranks.[5][6]
In2042, Shinobu Nakagawa died under mysterious circumstances, prompting a civil war within the Tyger Claws over the inheritance. After a great deal of bloodshed, Hayato Nakagawa won, inheriting theNakagawa Foundationand becoming the new leader of the Tyger Claws. He left the company to his trusted wife,Ryoko Fujiwara, who had been instrumental in his winning of the dispute. Hayato then took the name "Shinobu the Second" both to honor his predecessor and to cement his power base.Takeru AkagiandZenjyu-bouwould become two of his most trusted advisors, with the former leading the Kimen-Gumi.
In theory, with the Nakagawa Foundation's wealth and the backing of the NCCS, the Tyger Claws should have been a powerhouse in Night City, however, Ryoko took her role as guardian of the Foundation very seriously and doled the money carefully. Additionally, with the city beginning to stabilize, the individual corporate members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere begun to draw away from the Claws in favor of their own security forces and operatives, forcing the gang to rely mainly on their income from the security contracts acquired by the Kimen-Gumi and what they gained from their more illicit activities and legitimate business fronts. If all else failed, there were rumors suggesting the Claws possessed a stockpile of Arasaka weapons and gear left over from theFourth Corporate War.
While Hayato respected the wishes of his wife on how to maintain the financial stability of the Foundation, he thought it was increasingly difficult to retain respect from the local Japanese community and the Night City Co-prosperity Sphere. Publicly, the Tyger Claws remained dedicated to the vision of Shinobu, seeking to protect the Japanese community in Night City. Beneath the surface, however, they were seeking more power. Much like Arasaka before them, the Claws played by the rules, slowly integrating themselves in the communities and using their resources to provide aid and protection, while at the same time seizing control as much as possible.
By2045, Hayato had taken even more cybernetic enhancements to dull the pain as he felt the carefully built Tyger Claws empire was slipping away. At the same time,Maelstromwas looking to expand their operations into Old Japantown, causing them to clash with the local Claws.[5]The gang was also at odds with theKanzaki, one of the major few remainingyakuzafamilies in Night City. Despite these disputes, the Tyger Claws still had a major influence over Watson and Japantown, as well as a notorious presence inSouth Night CityandCharter Hill.[7]
In2067, a prostitute was brutally raped and murdered by Tyger Claw gangers.Elizabeth "Lizzie" Bordenavenged her by killing three of the assailants, but that same night Tyger Claws killed her. These actions created an uproar that the Claws could not have foreseen, with Lizzie's death setting off a wave of protracted riots all over Night City, and Tyger Claws' members and businesses became the main targets of the violence. Those events were cemented with the formation ofthe Moxgang. After reaching a deal with them, the Claws left the Mox alone, but there was always bad blood between both groups.[3]
During the2070s, the Tyger Claws were one of the largest criminal groups in Night City, controlling vast swaths of land inWestbrookandWatson. Based out of the newJapantown, the ruthless gang was known to use methods similar to those of Asian organized crime syndicates like thetriadsand theyakuza. Gang members were predominantly Asian, especially Japanese, and the gang's main objective was to maintain power over their territories while occasionally annexing other gangs' businesses.[1]Compared to their mostly humble beginnings, the Claws had changed little, their fixation on motorcycles for transportation continued, and they regularly used morecyberware. During these years, the gang had a close ties with the Arasaka Corporation.
Due to its size, there were a lot of internal disputes between the Tyger Claws, with different factions rising up and competing for money, territory and power. This occurrences, though, were handled from within the organization. However, if a dangerous outsider stepped into Claws territory, they would instead find the gang as a unified front. Once the interlopers had been dealt with, the internal wars could resume.[3]

6th Streetis agangoperating inNight City.
During the2070s, the uniforms of 6th Street gangers were heavily influenced by military and patriotic accents: military boots, tactical vests and knee pads, cargo pants, baseball caps withNUSAflags, stars, stripes, and eagles.Cyberwareused by the gang includedcyberoptics, pain editors, and health monitors.[2]They were supplied byMilitechandKendachi.
The gang consisted of about 2,300 members by 2077. 6th Street was formed about fifty years prior by veterans of theFourth Corporate Warwho were tired of the local gangs and the helplessness of theNCPDand decided to take matters into their own hands. They gathered some equipment, refreshed themselves on their training, and then took to the streets.
The gang was created to keep thugs and hoodlums at bay, and the charismatic leaders gave people a way protect themselves and seek retribution for the damage caused by other gangs. By the 2070s, 6th Street gangers were veterans of more recent conflicts, retired military and discharged corporate security officers who were unable to find other employment. The rest of the gang consisted of civilians who received military training after joining.
Their main headquarters was located inArroyo, but the other districts under their control had their own local HQs that were responsible for patrolling the neighborhood and monitoring the gang's facilities.[2]
6th Street's operations came to include robbery, extortion, and gun smuggling. The group also had extensive connections withnomadgroups inside and outside ofNight City. They also stole and modified cars, as 6th Street had talentedtechieswhich ran many garages and workshops around the city. They offered services as acombat taxifor hire, which made them especially popular among edgerunners and mercenaries.
Despite their criminal nature, the gang was mostly tolerated by corporations and police forces, unless 6th Street gangers caused trouble outside their established turf. Military oriented corporations had customers for high-end products and the NCPD's job was made easier by the ersatz law that the gang maintained in their neighborhoods.[2]
6th Street was founded in the mid-late2020sby ColonelSolomon Wright, also known as X, a formerUS militaryintelligence officer who organized many veterans of theFourth Corporate Warunder one banner in order to protect the citizens of the chaotic post-warNight City.[1]They gathered some equipment, refreshed their combat training, and took to the streets to keep thugs and othergangsat bay, giving the people a way to protect themselves and seek retribution for the damage caused by the criminals.[2]Basing their loose military structure on the ranks used during the war, they dispensed "justice" and protected "everyone" who followed the "law." X referred to 6th Street as anorganization, trying to grant them some legitimacy, though others knew they were just another gang. Wright divided the group's operations by the use the 3-I's principle of leadership; Investigations (detectives), Impact (troopers), and Internal (management). If 2/3rds disagreed with X on a command-staff vote, the former Colonel was overruled.[1]
During the early years of 6th Street, X blackmailed variouscorporateexecutives to fund the organization, which quickly became a lucrative strategy. Unfortunately for those executives, some would die in the following years by "natural" and not-so-natural consequences, while others were simply forced to stop by the employers. With this initial founding, 6th Street was aiming to replace the corruptNight City Police Departmentand bring the metropolis back into the fold of theUnited States. As their base of operations, 6th Street repurposed a nine-story National Guardarmorylocated inNorth Heywood, retrofitting the building to their needs. With their new headquarters, the gang continued to protect the various neighborhoods around Night City.
In the coming years, 6th Street increased its presence throughout the metropolis. Its members were well-armed and heavilychromedwith weaponry from their days in the field. Their HQ acted as the gang's FOB (Forward Operations Base), and included a customer service and business center, as well as a large vehicle bay and a floor dedicated to their R&R investigation. 6th Street was hoping to compete against bigger private security contractors such asMilitechorLazarus. An additional rule X put forward was the monthly update of cyberware, which required members to report on how much chrome they were wearing, and if it passed a certain limit, they would be released from service. This was likely done in case of a member goingcyberpsychoon a civilian.[3][1]
By the2040s, 6th Street had managed to be deputized as a private law enforcement contractor and were granted the official protection of the streets in North Heywood, which they patrolled on foot and on motorcycles, with regular shifts of groups ranging from four to six people. If things got worse during a patrol, a rapid-response FOB team was always ready to back them up, bringing heavily armored vehicles purchased from thenomads. Despite this contract, 6th Street kept operating all over Night City, and they were welcome protectors of theHoly Angels ChurchinLittle Europe.
During these years, there was people who called them guardians, protectors and nightmares-in-chrome, but regardless of their contracts, 6th Street was still a gang. As such and due to their high ambitions, 6th Street had been losing money really fast, and were expected to hit a rough patch in the following years. To avoid that, they were forced to move into extortion and smuggling in order to pay their bills. They had also begun to sell "confiscated" property to bring in more money, though all these actions were leading them to abandon all their "high ideals" if this was not resolved.[3][1]
By2045, 6th Street's primary unit for law enforcement wasDavis Squad, led by Wright's sonArbiter. They had good relations with the neighboring nomads, though this was bound to change as the gentrified North Heywood was expanding south, and it was only a matter of time before it reached the nomad occupied-Santo Domingo. The gang was dreaming of expanding their official status in North Heywood to all of Night City to achieve their goal of replacing the NCPD.[1]
During the following decades, the need of resources and corruption in 6th Street led them to forgo their original goal of serving public trust, and ended up no different from any other gang who abused their power and position in the local communities. Although they had started by simply taking bribes to look the other way on occasions, and charge locals small protection fees, they continued diving deep in the criminal world, eventually regularly forcing smaller neighborhood businesses to pay tribute and protection money, and were known to engage in outright criminal activities such as vehicle theft, illicit drug manufacturing and distribution, and murder.[2][4]At some point,Combat Cabaffiliated in some way with 6th Street.
By the2070s, 6th Street had control over most of theSanto Domingodistrict, and were aiming of expanding their territory. Many veterans of theUnification Warhad joined its ranks, as well as retired military and discharged security officers who were unable to find employment elsewhere. The rest of the members included civilians who were provided military training after joining the gang. 6th Street's vision was still to "bring justice to the city," though their interpretation of the law was very questionable and self-serving. With multiple facilities across some of the districts of Night City, the gang continued to patrol the neighborhoods and monitor other gang hideouts.[2]By2071, theValentinosand 6th Street had been in a turf war for some time, with their latest conflict during that year being a firefight inWestbrook.[5]At some point prior or during2074, the Valentinos and 6th Street would escalate their turf war over the control ofVista del Rey.[2]
Around late2076, the gang underwent a sudden change in leadership, the culmination of a schism between members who were fine with dealing with corporations and members who considered such activities to be a betrayal of the gang's founding principles. The anti-corpo faction, led byWill Gunner, seized power in a coup when Gunner brazenly killed the gang's leader at the time, "General"Rick Morton. What followed in the subsequent months was a bloody purge of Morton's lieutenants, loyalists, and other associates as Gunner's people consolidated their grip over 6th Street.
By2077, the war between the Valentinos and 6th Street was intensifying, with Vista del Rey being more dangerous than ever. Despite Gunner's anti-corpo stance, 6th Street continued to work with some corporations, and even secretly cooperated withKendachito design a new line of weapons.

The Mox, also known as theMoxes, are agangoperating inNight City.
During the2070s, the Mox were a small gang based out ofLizzie's BarinKabuki. They were made up of outcasts of different backgrounds inNight City, mostly sex workers, anarchists, punks, and sexual minorities. Formed in the interest of mutual self-defense purposes, their name came from the old slang term "moxie," denoting their determination to stand up against their oppressors. One of their emblems was "Moxes" written in calligraphy.
The Mox liked to wear outfits that were a mix of the punk aesthetic and the inexpensive fashion worn typically by prostitutes; however they usually did not wear clothes that would restrain their movements in any way, leaving them looking more like gangers than your typical sex workers. Some members, especially those who focused on combat, had heavily modified bodies that sometimes evoked a "plastic doll" style, but could also be disguised withRealSkinn. One of their gang symbols was a labrys, a double-headed axe, displayed on their walls, clothes, tattoos, or jewelry.[1]
The Moxes had their own clothing brand that went by the nameBITCH V.13. While most Mox gangers carried bats and clubs, Mox Cleavers and Inciters generally carried weaponry similarly used by theTyger Clawsgang, likely pilfered from their fallen opponents in the ongoing conflict between the rival factions.
The Mox did not have strict hierarchy. Nevertheless, they were a gang, and regardless of the fact that its members referred to themselves as "those who protect working girls and guys" from violence and abuse, they demanded substantial fee from their charges. They also run several smaller brothels where they profit from prostitution, as well as clinics.[1]
Most of the Moxes' income was generated by Lizzie's Bar, which was an exclusivebraindanceclub. They did not control any contiguous portion of Night City, focusing instead on protecting their facilities, members, and sex workers who operated in the vicinity of Lizzie's Bar and their other establishments. As long as they were left to their business, they did not actively seek confrontation with other gangs, although they mantained tense relations with the Tyger Claws, who continued to test their patience and combat capabilities.[1]
The Moxes formed during the riots that occurred after the death ofElizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, a strip club owner and former prostitute who was known for treating her workers fairly and defending them from violent clients.[1]This occurred on May 132067,[2]when one of Lizzie's girls was brutally raped and murdered by members of theTyger Clawsgang. Lizzie avenged her by killing three of the assailants with an axe and displayed their bodies in front ofher club, proclaiming that the same would happen to anyone else who hurt a prostitute. That same night, Tyger Claws raided and demolished her bar before killing Elizabeth.[1][3]
These actions created an uproar that the Claws could not have foreseen, with Lizzie's death setting off a wave of protracted riots all overNight City, with Tyger Claws' members and businesses becoming the main targets of the violence. Those events cemented Elizabeth Borden as a symbol of defiance against gangers' lawlessness and brutality. Her ideological successors commemorated her by rebuilding her place, naming it "Lizzie's Bar," and forming the Mox, a gang that brought together those who felt threatened and oppressed, especially among sex workers and sexual minorities.[1][3]
Over the following years, the Moxes established themselves as "those who protect working girls and guys" from violence and abuse, but they sill needed an income. The Mox begun to demand substantial fee from their help, and also run several smaller brothels where they profited from prostitution. They managed to transform Lizzie's Bar into an exclusivebraindanceclub, becoming a major portion of their income,[1]and also released their own clothing brand,BITCH V.13.[4]Their territory wasn't so much a patch of land as it was a profession.[3]
By2077, the Moxes leadership underSusie "Q"hardened as they realized they were not able to protect every sex worker in Night City, but just the ones who worked directly for them. As the gang grew more cynical, some begun to worry they were becoming the oppressors they were formed to fight.[3]

TheScavengers, also known asScavs, are an organization made of multiple groups operating inNight City. They are known for kidnapping people and forcibly harvesting theircyberware.
Scavengers can be found all overNight City. They deal in selling to the black market cyberware forcefully ripped from their unsuspected victims. They are ruthless and care little for anyone else around them.
Members speak European languages and have some Russian graffiti, and listen to Russian music.[2]Scavengers are recognized by their tracksuits, Soviet cyberware, and criminal tattoos.
Scavenger are ruthless lowlife scum who prey on unwary law-abiding citizens and gangers alike. They emerged as a side effect of the mass availability of body augmentations. Harvestingcyberwareand organs is a nasty but profitable business, and Scavengers fill this niche by assaulting their victims on the streets. They are absolutely brutal with zero regard to human life. To a Scav, a human is just a set of products waiting to be sold on the black market.[1]
Scavengers do not obey any particular philosophy. They do not care about anything but themselves and profit. They are merciless and immoral, their methods are far from sophisticated- Scavs are not afraid to get their hands dirty. This loosely defined gang has achieved a monopoly in the body parts aftermarket, since their customers would rather pay for human organs and second-hand cyberware than get into the gore business themselves. Cyberware used by the gang include cyberoptics, pain editors, health monitors, Kereznikov, and K.E.R.S.
Scavengers tend to operate in small groups, with no official hierarchy to unite them,[3]nor do they have a designated piece of turf. Their groups are spread throughoutNight Cityand mark their presence with tags and graffiti. They can be found anywhere but they have a more concentrated presence in northernPacificaand southern part of Wellsprings. Due to this scattering, they tend to form small bands with little or no internal hierarchy or structure, though groups tend to be led by the most unscrupulous, savage, and cunning individuals. Despite their lack of organized structure, Scavenger groups are definitely not to be disregarded or taken lightly. Knowing that their gruesome reputation is one of their few assets, they will make sure to make a grisly example of anyone who crosses them or complicates their business.[1]
Assault, abduction, mutilation, and dismemberment are the Scavengers' usual modus operandi. Their victims, or "donors" as Scavs call them, are often never found, because the gang tend to use the entire body of their victims. Any cyberware or organs that can be harvested or sold are placed on the black market. The impossible to find leftovers are either dumped, burned, or left as fodder for rats in the city sewers.
Scavengers are the main suppliers for low-end cyberware for other gangs, small-time criminals, and shadyripperdocs. They are also frequently hired to perform unpleasant or inconvenient tasks with which their clients do not want to be associated, be they heists, hit jobs, and abductions. As long as there is money on the table, a Scav will take the job no questions asked.[1]
Scavengers were first featured in theCyberpunk 2077E3 2018trailer, where they engage in combat withTrauma Team International.
Scavengers were later featured in the Cyberpunk 2077 48-minute gameplay reveal, where they engage in combat withVandJackie Welles.

The Wraiths are the largest group of Raffen Shiv, or roguenomads. This group mostly travels at night, preying on the sleeping and unwary. Their leader is namedDogkiller, and is rumored to wear clothing of human skin.[2]
The Wraiths are one of the two prominent nomad groups inhabiting theBadlands. They have a long history of frequent conflict and warring with the other nomad group, theAldecaldos.[3]
While nomads usually operate in a judicial grey area, the Wraiths ignore the law. They are vicious as well as aggressive and have dominated the areas surroundingNight City. They raid small villages as well as attack small groups of nomads and attack weakly guarded corp transports.Cyberwareand other equipment used by the gang include reflex boosters, pain editors, heavily modified vehicles, and possibly military-grade equipment.[1]
What little is known of the Wraiths' origins is that they were one of the many nomad-originating gangs on the West Coast, presumably consisting of exiles fromnomadnations. The size of the gang is also unknown but they are presumably the size of an average nomad clan, between 300 to 1,200 members.[1]
The main source of income for the Wraiths are the spoils from their raids. They sometimes go to big cities for transportation contracts, but are notoriously unreliable. They often break agreements and keep the loot they were supposed to transport or keep the passengers, either for ransom or for their own enjoyment.[1]Similar to theScavengers, the Wraiths would also kidnap people and kill them for their bodyparts and chrome, which they would extract and sell.[4]For a time, the Wraiths also cooperated with a netrunner calledb@d, who provided them with lucrative intel on aMaelstromdrug stash they subsequently raided[5][6][7][8]as well as with a virus that they used to disable drones passing byUnion Railroadso that their cargo can then be stolen.[9][10]

TheAldecaldosare one of the largestnomadgroups in North America, and a member of theSeven Nations.
The Aldecaldo family was the first true nomad family to form during the 1990s asLos Angelesturned into a warzone.Juan Aldecaldostarted out in the defense industry, and much of the extended Aldecaldo family depended on Juan for various needs. Juan led a family migration from theUStoMexico City, and as time went on his leadership became stronger. The Aldecaldos returned to the US with an increased number of nomads.
In 2077, the Aldecaldos are one of the two nomad groups inhabiting theBadlands. They have a long history of frequent conflict with theRaffen Shivgroup who call themselves theWraiths. Unlike their aggressive rivals, the Aldecaldos are more open to making deals withV.[5]
They make temporary camps in the desert but never as a single group simultaneously. Their caravans operate in theFree Stateson the West Coast where they transport passengers and merchandise over state borders in large, well-guarded convoys.Cyberwareand other equipment used by the gang include reflex boosters and heavily modified cars and bikes.[3]
In addition to scavenging and hiring themselves out as manual farm laborers, Aldecaldos also engage in bootlegging and transporting stolen goods. Some clans and families focus solely on smuggling and delivering their "packages" all along the Nomad Trail all the way to the twin Crime Cities, which are Chicago and Phoenix.[3]
The Aldecaldo family was the first truenomadfamily to form, beginning as casualties of the city. Before theCollapse, Los Angeles was arguably one of the greatest cities in the world. It was also, in some areas, one of the worst. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Los Angeles devolved into a war zone, as did so many of America's inner cities. There was rampant drug dealing, prostitution, gang activity, theft, arson, and all species of violence. The only thing missing was hope.
Los Angeles was not just where they made movies, it was also what they made movies about. The movies were about cops and gangs, the rich and famous, and the city that made the movies. They still have not made a film aboutJuan Aldecaldoand with everything that has happened, they never will. Juan's story begins before that, before the quake took so much of LA into the sea.
Juan started life as a migrant. He had a stable home life, and received a decent education in the California school system. He went to college, the first of his family to do so, and received a engineering degree. From there, he entered the defense industry and tried to raise his family as best he could.
The defense industry took numerous hits in the two decades before the Collapse. A lack of war and a lack of budget forced much of the industry to down-size, putting Juan out of work. Much of the extended Aldecaldo family depended on Juan, and he did what he could to help them; taking a job in a grocery to ward off collectors, selling his home to buy enough food. In spite of his efforts, the family spiraled downward into cheaper neighborhoods, again and again, until they were living in the city's worst slum. He implored his son and his daughter to remain in school and escape their bleak future. His daughter, Maria, was killed in a car accident the day before her seventeenth birthday. His son Ramon, greatly distressed by his sister's death, eventually dropped out of school. He started seeing a Filipino girl who was a member of the Red Dogs gang, and eventually he became a member as well. Ramon was shot to death in a so-called robbery/homicide on his nineteenth birthday. His father was only a few blocks away when it happened. The police and of course the ever-present media were at the scene. No one knows what the newsmen said to Juan Aldecaldo, but his reply was replayed on television screens all across America.
"There is no place for you here! I want to see the surveillance camera tapes! Do you even have the sense to look? What are you people, jackals and vultures who make your living off of the poor victims of this country? My son was a good boy - you tell your audience that. He was a good boy with a good family in hard times. If we had been able to send him to school he would have been a great man, not like you and your cameras, a good man. All he wanted was for his mother not to be threatened. For his family to have a nice house. Who of you has such lofty goals? You are as bad as the police. They come here and fill out their reports. They say they will do 'all they can' to find the killers of my son and they lie!"
In 2002, the Padre died of a heart attack in his sleep. Juan struggled on alone, leading the family as best he could, and the Aldecaldos continued to prosper and grow under his guidance. He began seeking a successor as he grew older, though none would be found for a long time. Elders argued for an election, but Juan wanted no part of politics; he knew any type of internal competition would eventually ruin the family. Just before the Mexico City re-development contract was signed, Juan Aldecaldo suffered a heart attack, and though it set him back personally, he pushed the family forward.
The years in Mexico City were good for the Clan. Juan's health improved, and the family had time to consolidate and re-equip themselves. Though grisly in the beginning, Mexico City proved to be very lucrative as well. When the walkers came across Mexico, they received help from the Aldecaldos, and assistance moving on to other nomad families if they wanted it. The Government was not happy with the Aldecaldos' actions, and they tried to prevent the clan from coming back over the border. There were too many nomads, though, and not enough border guards.
When the Aldecaldo Clan returned to the US in 2015, they brought a few extras with them. They brought the body of Juan Aldecaldo, to be buried near his wife and children in Los Angeles. They brought a new group of nomads, fresh from the Long Walk, and bitter about the way they had been treated. They also brought back America's favorite rockerboy,Johnny Silverhand, who had been hiding with them for most of two years. Their most telling change, however, was a new leader: a man namedSantiago. Raised in the Clan, and tempered by dealings with the Long Walk, the charismatic Santiago was appointed leader at Juan's deathbed. For many years he was simply Santiago, but now he was Santiago Aldecaldo.[1][2]
In2045, the Aldecaldos were known for being involved in construction, transport, and mercenary work.[6]
Around 2077,Saul Brightled his Aldecaldofamilyto theBadlandsofNight Cityin order to find new work for them.[7]

Night City is considered a modern multicultural metropolis of the 21st-century, overrun bycorporations, corruption, organized crime andgangviolence.[1]
Night City has wide streets and dense urban skyscrapers which are home to millions of residents. By2077, it operates as a city-state, officially owning the title ofFree City, with theArasaka Corporationkeeping a heavy influence over it. The metropolis is considered a thrilling and exciting location to visit, as well as an interesting and vibrant place to live for those of means, and a hellscape to the city's disenfranchised. Its world famous slogan is"The City of Dreams,"originally changed from"City on the Edge of Tomorrow."[5]
Night City is located on the Pacific Coast of North America, in a region known asDel Coronado Bayarea in Central California. Nearby major city travel ranges from 4 to 6 hours toSan FranciscoandLos Angeles, depending on road gang conditions and road quality.[2]
After the rebuild stage, the city's location remained largely the same, with slight differences it the landscape around it. Night City is surrounded by theBadlands, which is mostly unpleasant, however due to theBiotechnicaprotein farms, thesouth sideis considered not as bad as theeastern partof the surrounding region.
After buying out the terrains ofMorro Bayand its surroundings — including areas ofLos Ososas well — Richard Night begun the construction of his city by first rearranging the terrain. Keeping with Night's vision, Coronado City was originally divided into neighborhoods — each with a different architectural style and theme. Night hoped to bring in a vibrant multi-cultural population attracted to each neighborhood.[2]
With Richard Night's death, the then renamed Night City disintegrated into a hodgepodge of competing districts, savaged by gangs, and later controlled by domineering megacorporations. Besides the neighborhoods, the city was also surrounded by larger suburban areas known asNorth Oak,Westbrook,Heywood,Rancho CoronadoandPacifica, while the Central City borderedSouth Night Cityas well.[2]The tallest hill in Central Night City wasWest Hill, with its peak occupied by ahotel.
In the originalCyberpunk 2020TTRPG, the city was additionally ordered by Sections, being A through C Central Night City, D the violent crime-ridden hell known as theCombat Zone, and E through J the wider suburban areas.[1]
Night City was devastated during theFourth Corporate War. After the nuke, the majority of the population became homeless and the sky was red for decades — a period known as theTime of the Red. During the next decades, Night City was in the process of rebuilding. The old neighborhoods of the 2020 period had been rearranged, renamed, or even scraped off into the bay if they were too radioactive, while theoriginal heartof the metropolis was still completely devastated.
The new districts were governed by theirCity Manager, who represented the interests of the area's major powers.[6]In addition to the urban re-designation, each new area was given a "threat rating" by theCity Council— a designation of how dangerous the neighborhood was.[2]
At that time Night City residents mentally divided the city into four areas:The Island,Northside,Mainland, andSouthside, with each area containing multiple districts.[6]Some locals also referred to these areas based on the type of environment they were dominated by, with majority belonging to eighter theOverpacked Suburbs, theRebuilding Urban Zonesor theCombat Zones.[2]
After the Time of the Red and the Unification War, Night City was mostly rebuilt and had maintained its autonomy. By 2077, the city was overrun with crime, its rate doubling that of the NUSA. The homeless population had been a problem since the early 2000s, and in 2077 had risen by 300%. Each district was dominated by at least one powerful gang.[M 2]The city was divided into six districts — each with their own environment and denizens — and 16 official sub-districts. The total size of the city was around 75.42 km².[3]
Night City's Northern Californian location gives it one of the most pleasant climates in the Western part of the NUSA. Normal temperatures range from the mid 80°F to low 50°F (26°C to 10°C), with misty white fog blanketing the City in the early mornings and evenings. Night City receives around 21 inches of rainfall each year. Of this water that drops, around 35% contains toxic chemicals which is higher than the current government standards for the United States produced vehicles, clothing, and food. On average, if a person's vehicle and clothing are rated above SP 12, adverse effects (staining and ablation) will be negligible.
When one visits Night City, they should wear light to medium weight clothing, with an optional light armor jacket or ballistic-cloth overcoat. A filter mask and supplemental oxygen, hedges against inversion smog and acid rain fog, are highly recommended as well. That being said, acid-proof slickers, umbrellas, and air masks are readily available from the sidewalk vendors or smaller street stores during smog warning periods. The average cost of these items can range from €$20 to €$35.
The business sectors of Night City include manufacturing industries, international trade and commerce, information services, electronic technologies, security services, and so on. While cities likeTokyo,New YorkorSingaporehave been overrun by corporations by the 2000s, Night City was the only city in the world that was built by the corporations. Some of the biggest megacorporations in the world contributed to the construction of the city and many were located in theCorporate Centerin 2020. After the war, and the subsequent reconstruction of Night City,Corporate Plazabecame a symbol of the megacorps' grasp on the city.
Night City was founded through the efforts of a partnership of five majorcorporations, and as of 2077 it continues to serve as a haven for numerous global corporations due to its status as a free city and pro-corporate government policies such as a 0.7% tax rate on corporate profits.[7]Night City's biggest ally is Arasaka, which provides employment for many citizens and ensures the city remains independent by backing it with its military strength.[1]In2077, the five best corporations to work with were considered to be Arasaka, Militech, Biotechnica, Kang Tao and Night Corp.[8]
By 2077, Night City has two notable sports franchises: theNight City Corsairsfootball team, and theNight City Blackoutsbasketball team. While the Corsairs recently achieved a notable victory against theSan Diego Shreddersdue to their Night Corp sponsorship giving them access to cutting-edge cyberware designed specifically for the sport, the Blackouts are in the midst of a long losing streak.
Operating as an autonomous territory separate from the rest of the NUSA, Night City's borders are patrolled by Arasaka contractors. TheNight City Police Departmentholds jurisdiction over domestic security, although the personal security detail of the mayor is handled by a team of handpicked corporate huscle (hired muscle). In 2077, there were two known prisons in the city area:Night City PrisonandLos Padres Penitentiary.
Night City hosts an extensive network of urban freeways and rapid transit networks. Getting from the city's various districts is seamless and effective except for in districts where the infrastructure has been damaged such as inPacifica. Also, the spaceport is an aerospace center in Night City, allowing for space transportation. Private taxi companies likeDelamain CorporationorCombat Caboffer their services as well.
In 2020,NCARTprovided rapid maglev transportation around the city, whileNCTCprovided bus services and controlled mass transit traffic.Amerilineadditionally offered bus services to and from theMetropolitan Airportand other cities across the United States.
In 2020, Night City was part of the intercontinentalMaglev Networkthat went from the West to the East Coast. It was abandoned during the Fourth Corporate War, but there were plans to revitalizing it by the late 2070s. At least another maglev line is shown in thePhantom Liberty Cinematic Trailer, which goes through Westbrook and Santo Domingo, then south to SoCal.
In 2020, theNight City Metropolitan Airportwas the main airfield in NC. Since 2047, theNCX Spaceporthas been operating onMorro Rockisland, west of the NC's downtown.
Around the 2020s, Night City connected to Highways828(which continued east to connect with I-5),928,126, and theGibson Freewayloop. By 2077,Interstate 9andHighway 101were its main freeways, with theNight City Ringroadcircling around its districts.
By 2077 there were at least two major cargo railway depots in Night City. One was a sizablecargo freight stationinSanto Domingo, with a railway that extended eastward into North California. Another one was located inWatson, used mostly for the cargo container ships in thedocks. This large depot connected with various railways across theNorthside Industrial District. One went north outside of the city limits, while a few others went into each of the dock piers. Another one was headed into theArasaka Waterfront, another south into the city, and finally, one railway disappeared into the hills to the east.
Night City has gone through many changes since its creation in 1989. The city was initially made with a layout similar toSan Francisco, but with the introduction of its suburbs - and later its renewed appearance inCyberpunk REDandCyberpunk 2077- it has changed significantly. While the main RPG area of the game inCyberpunk 2013andCyberpunk 2020was Central Night City (mostly 2077'sCity Centerand some areas ofHeywood), during the development of bothREDand2077it was decided to expand the city and incorporate its surroundings, and at the same time the city's geography was made to resemble that of the realMorro Bay.
During the development of theEdgerunners Guide to Night Citysourcebook forCyberpunk RED, in order to answer the difference of the city's layout between 2020-2045-2077, some changes were made following the rough guidance from areworkof the 2020 city map.[R 4]
According toMike PondsmithandR. Talsorian Games, Night City occupies the same area asMorro BayandBaywood-Los Osos, two towns located on the Californian central coast. But the geography has been heavily modified in the lore and it doesn't really resemble the real location anymore.See also:Morro Bay;Los Osos.

Santo Domingo(English:Saint Dominic) is one of the six districts ofNight CityinCyberpunk 2077, and widely known for being the more industrial one.
This district originates from the oldHeywood, which by the2040swas already being called Santo Domingo.[1]As such, it is one of the oldest districts inNight City. Due to its location, the district avoided any major damage from the4th Corporate War. It turned into a provisional camp for thousands of citizens seeking shelter. By 2077, the settlements were all gone and Santo Domingo had become a testing ground for industrial projects; corporations destroy old factories, only to build new ones in their place.
Meanwhile, residents seek a desperate living in the crowdedmegabuildings- hoping for better things to come. It didn't take long for a couple of ex-military veterans to group together and take matters into their own hands. The district then became home to the6th StreetGang.
Arroyois the industrial heart of Santo Domingo. This region of contrast you can find an old power plant and junkyard right next to newly built high-tech corporate factories. Operational factories keep their own private security, as neglected buildings quickly become controlled by the gangs.
The workers from Arroyo then return home toRancho Coronado- a self-sufficient housing district with dozens of identical homes. This neighborhood is reminiscent of the traditional American homes of the early 20th century.

Dogtownis aCombat Zoneand one of the sub-districts ofPacifica, located in southernNight City. Before the creation of Dogtown, this area was known asSerenisands.
Dogtown is exclusive toCyberpunk 2077:Phantom Libertyand will become accessible during the questDog Eat Dog.
Dogtown is a walled-off area located east of thePacificasub-districts ofCoastviewandWest Wind Estate.[2]It is divided into different areas includingLongshore Stacks,Golden Pacific,Luxor Heights,Terra Cognitaand more, all controlled byBARGHEST.[3]Its main entrance is located north of theEBM Petrochem Stadium, in Coastview.[4]The fastest way to enter and exit Dogtown is through the western gate, which also leads to Coastview.
In the late2050s, investors funded the Pacifica district of Night City to become a wealthy touristic destination, withMilitechbeing its major investor.[5][6]This area of eastern Pacifica was to be called Serenisands.[5][7]Major construction companies involved includedHFS,Zhirafa,Corp-Bud,Aurochs, among others.
In the following years, Pacifica's old buildings were demolished to give space to new ones. A large explosion under a construction site in Serenisands halted the process in the surrounding area. Investigations were issued, but it was never determined the cause, prompting to double the local security detail. The truth was that in the2020sMilitech had built an extensive network of laboratories and bunkers hidden beneath Pacifica's infrastructure, only to be abandoned at some point prior to theFourth Corporate War. Rumors said that the expulsion had been caused after accidentally uncovering part ofCynosure's project. Due to this,Night City Councildecided to wall-off Serenisands, giving the excuse of a gas leak, and Militech constructed a large wall around the district. Construction was resumed, and for a time the new measures were enough to bring investors back.[8][9][5]Many of the new projects were planned to be showcased at theFounding Our Future Innovation EXPO— including models of theEventide Resort & Spa, theHeavy Hearts Club, and a never-built Militech headquarters based in Night City.[10]TheEBM Petrochem Stadiumwas to be the crowning jewel of Serenisands.[11]
TheUnification War(2069-2070) halted Pacifica's success in its tracks. As fears mounted that theNew United Stateswould invade Night City fromSouthern Californiaand Pacifica would then become a battlefield,corporationsand other investors raced to withdraw their fundings from the district's ongoing projects.[12][13]
It was during the war when NUSA ColonelKurt Hansenasserted control of a portion of Pacifica. Hansen ignored his orders to leave the area after the war, showing his disdain for theArvin Accord, and carved his own private paradise, eventually becoming some sort of military tyrant.[3][14][15]With Night City's economy already on a downturn, the effect on Pacifica was disastrous and much of the district was left incomplete and lawless. Construction work was put on permanent hold, leaving most buildings as unfinished hulks of concrete and steel. Not long after,gangsand the homeless moved in. Former Serenisands — controlled by Hansen's people — became aCombat Zone, and at some point was cut-off from the rest of Pacifica.[13]
Although it was originally simply known as the Combat Zone, people started to refer to it as Dogtown due to Hansen and hisBARGHESTmilitia.[16]
Instead of scrapping the cargoaerozepthat crashed into theEBM Petrochem Stadium, Dogtown repurposed its nuclear engine to feed the district's energy demand without depending on exterior suppliers.[17]
After establishing Dogtown'sBlack Market, gun trade and other unsavory dealings turned the former area of Pacifica into a very profitable business. As such, the powers-that-be decided to leave it alone, allowing Hansen to continue as its ruler. With no corporations or outside laws, Dogtown's upper echelon thrived in it, while the rest of the district's citizens teetered on the brink of poverty.[15]For years, many people arrived there in hopes of escaping their past and find a better life within its walls. What they didn't realize is that they were simply changing one overlord for another.[18]
By2077, Dogtown was still under the iron fist of Colonel Hansen and his militia.[14]Around this time, NUSAPresident Myers'sSpace Force Onewas struck down above Night City, eventually crash-landing somewhere within Dogtown.[19]

Konpeki Plaza(stylized as紺碧プラザ, translation: "Azure Plaza") is a luxury hotel located in theArasaka Waterfront, in theWatsondistrict of northernNight City.
Part of a global luxury hotel chain owned by theArasaka Corporation,[1]theNight CityKonpeki Plaza was built with the idea of allowing guests to have a sublime artistic experience, as such, the structure incorporated elements from "Americanlargesse" and "Japaneseminimalism," soon becoming the most exclusive hotel in all of Night City, devoted to luxury and decadent entertainment.[2][3]
Ever since its construction, the hotel advertised itself as a temporal residence for the world'scorporateelite, frequented by executives from out of town, and with a lobby bar popular for being a place to mingle with the city's most powerful, including themayor. However, it was said this branch paled in comparison to the main hotel inTokyo.[2][4][3]
In2077,Yorinobu Arasakabooked the hotel's penthouse at the Night City hotel after stealing theRelicbiochip from his father,Saburo. During his stay, the Relic became the target of theVoodoo Boysand thenEvelyn Parker, who hiredfixerDexter DeShawnto steal the chip so she could sell it toNetWatch.V,Jackie Welles, andT-Bugwere recruited forthe heist, with the former two posing asMilitechoperatives making a weapons sale to a guest in order to gain entry. Then they used a robot known as theFlatheadto disable security and enter the penthouse to steal the biochip. Before they could leave with the Relic in hand, they witnessed Yorinobu murdering his father, and were forced to deal with hotel guards after Yorinobu ordered the building to be placed under lockdown. T-Bug was burned by Arasaka netrunners, and Jackie was fatally wounded. After the incident, Konpeki Plaza was closed indefinitely.[1]
Night City's Konpeki Plaza is located in an enclosed space adjacent to the main area of theArasaka WaterfrontandDel Coronado Bay, in the district ofWatson. Due to its close ties with Arasaka, the corp provides security.[1]Those seeking to work at Konpeki Plaza must meet several stringent requirements before they will even be considered. Prospective employees must have above-average looks, fluently speak English and Japanese plus a minimum of two other languages, be physically fit, and be willing to accept 4th generationcyberwareimplants across their entire body.[2]The hotel chain has locations inTokyo,Singapore,Paris,Washington, D.C., andNight City.[5]
The building is divided between 80 floors, 420 rooms, 20 conference halls, and a top floor penthouse reserved for VIPs. It has at least two elevators and staircases, one for each tower, and another elevator in the lobby to access the subterranean parking lot. Guests have 24-hour access to the fully stocked bar, an art gallery, a sauna, a swimming pool, a gym, a massage parlor, a newly openedbraindancetheater, and other attractions on the ground floor or the sublevels. The interior architecture is made from gilded oak and marble, adorned with works of art from the finest artists. The exterior is surrounded by gardens, with a bar-restaurant found right next to the northwestern wall. Circling the building, a road goes from the street gates to the opposite side of the building, where the hotel's main doors are located, overlooking the bay. The southeastern part of the hotel has the subterranean garage entrance.[2][1]
Konpeki Plaza is divided in three sections, the main building which contains the parking area, the lobby, the bar, and part of the security. Then, two towers raise above — in a similar fashion to the oldArasaka Towers— with a few bridges connecting both structures. The northwestern tower has the building's penthouse, which rises above the rest, and it includes anAVparking lot. Much of Konpeki Plaza is made up of hotel rooms, but the higher floors have a variety of resting, office, conference, and private areas.[1]

[문서 제목: Cyberware]
출처: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberware
Cyberwareis the term used to describe cybernetic technology which is grafted in or onto a living body. Even though cybernetic prosthetics were originally developed for practical and medical purposes, they've since become a matter of lifestyle choice. Cyberware has become as commonplace as tattoos and jewelry. The reasons for installing it are many and varied, including simple tech upgrades, combat enhancements, and even fashion statements. The possession of trendy cyberware has become an integral and defining part ofNight Cityculture. Uniqueness is just another form of currency. To make it big, you need to look the part. Style is everything.
Cyberware is any cybernetic technology permanently installed into the body, especially technology that interfaces with the central nervous system. All Cyberware is artificial. Biological enhancements are considered a separate category, collectively referred to asBioware. Cyberware generally refers to technology that interacts with (or acts in place of) the nervous system. People with artificial hip joints or pacemakers are not generally considered cyborgs, even though part of their body is artificial.
Cyberware is commonplace in the cyberpunk world. It is a post-human society, where your meat body is little more than a tool to enhance for functionality or appearance.Cyberfashion(sometimes referred to as Fashionware) is its own niche in the cyberpunk world; enhancing your body for no other reason than looks. Beside status, cybernetics are most often desired for practical applications. For most people, the main concern with cybernetics is simply being able to afford them.
While cybernetics are still expensive, they are affordable by most of the middle class to some degree, and even by the poor in some situations. The working class, especially professionals, often have two or three implants of some kind. Cyberoptics are useful for recording meetings. Cyberaudio with boosted sensitivity could be useful for eavesdropping on gossips in the executive lounge. While the world of Cyberpunk is a much more violent society, there are plenty of non-violent, everyday uses for Cybernetics that make them desirable to almost everyone. Installing cybertechnology is generally considered a major purchase (like buying a laptop, TV, or car), but is still within the means of most people.
Cybertechnology can be acquired almost anywhere. Some installations are trivial, and can be done with a walk-in visit. There are many chain stores that can perform these (Bodyshoppe, Fashion/Fusion, Parts'N'Programs, etc.). These shops can also upgrade, repair, or tune existing cyberware. Other installations will require an actual hospital, and involve recovery time. As in the real world, the quality will depend on what you're willing to spend. Mall stores are considered middle of the road. Specialist clinics can deliver much higher quality installations. And for the desperate or the criminal, there areripperdocs.
Ripperdocs are underground medtechs that can perform installations cheaply, but with a serious cost in quality and integrity. Ripperdocs do not follow the medical codes and procedures of the mall stores, clinics or hospitals. This can lead to complications such as additional pain. Ripperdocs are also used by the underworld for installing illegal cyberware.
Cyberware installation involves the use ofnanotechto establish an interface between the module and the nervous system in the body. There is no limit to how much of the body can be modified. Full body conversions involve replacing virtually everything except the brain. It is difficult (some would say impossible) to avoid cyberpsychosis in such a situation however, so full body conversions are rare.
Once implanted, most cyberware requires regular maintenance to continue functioning properly. Implant components can degrade over time, and minute changes in a person's body chemistry can affect precision, response times, and overall functionality. Even the nanites in some forms of bioware must be occasionally recalibrated to ensure continued physiological compatibility. In severe cases, a faulty implant can become entirely inoperable, or otherwise endanger the life of its user. Consequently, checkups to service implanted cyberware are recommended at least once every sixth months.[1]
In the 2070s, neuroviruses contracted via infected personal links can also compromise implant functionality.[2]
These are high tech exoskeletons that resemble contoured body armor. These frames go past the limitations of conventional cyberlimbs; because the frame does not rely on the meat body to brace itself, it allows for truly superhuman feats, such as lifting small cars or bending steel bars with your hands. They have some limitations: you cannot swim with them, and they will slow your reflexes. You are effectively going to be wearing perpetual body armor for the rest of your life.
Linear frameshave an enormous humanity cost associated with them, easily ten times or more than that of a standard cyberlimb, socyberpsychosisis a genuine concern if you get one installed.
This involves grafting actual armor plates into your body. Unlike Subdermal Armor, this stuff is ontopof the skin, but it is as permanent as any other cyber implant.Body platingcan be installed in sections, or over your entire body. It can also be incorporated into Linear frames and other Cyberware.
The armor is more complicated than just slapping steel plates onto your skin, though. It has many layers and is porous (your skin still exists underneath, as does your meat body). From the outside though, you will resemble a robot. Body plating does not need to look especially robotic or ugly, however. It can be styled, like anything else. Many body plated women resemble sexy robot pictures popular in the 70s and 80s. A good example is the image to the right. It can be styled in almost any way, including minimalist designs (do you want a basic reflective ovoid sphere for a head?) or fearsome and intimidating creatures from fantasy (would you like to look like a metal manticore?). Your imagination is the only real limit.
People who have body plating are basically immune to the trivial damage that the rest of us worry about (cuts and scrapes and stuff). Body plating offers better damage resistance than even Subdermal Armor, and can be enhanced even further, if desired.
In the majority of full body conversions, the spine, brain and adrenal systems are transplanted into a fluid-filled support sack within a fully cybernetic body, in which nutrients are infused. The nutrients are infused via an IV that plugs into a port on the external shell, or derived from masticated food that passes through a "blender" into a separate digestive chamber and is then sent to a processing food holder that routes the vitamins to the support sack.
Meanwhile, the actual metal body frame is powered by a rechargeable battery with a multi-day charge. The skin is chrome implanted RealSkinn similar to the type used on cyberlimbs; it's soft and warm, but hairless and shiny. There's a neural net that ties sensors in the skin to the brain—the tech is similar to what is used for things like theMr. Studdsexual implant.[3]
At the start of the 21st century, medical prostheses were mainly implants made to replace parts of the body, such as teeth, facial bones, palate, or joints. Cyberware in the modern day is the evolution of these prostheses. In order to save human lives, medical science created artificial heart valves, extremities, and vertebrae, allowing patients who suffered from severe body trauma to function normally in society.
During theFirst Central American Warof the early 1990s, the development of cyberware increased significantly when thousands of American soldiers came home severely injured. Medical cyberware became more sophisticated and widespread as technology progressed.JapanandGermanywere at the forefront of development and research as the medicine was evolving. However, despite the amazing innovations in the medical field and how widespread cyberware was becoming, it was still expensive. The first prosthetic arm didn't have any fingers; instead, it had a crude gripper and the arm as a whole was heavy. These primitive designs of the 1990s are known as Generation Zero designs.[4]
The postwar medical cyberware prosthesis development helped to speed up the miniaturization process. Reinforced spines and joints were first designed for workers, air filters grafted in the upper respiratory tracts for those working in polluted environments. Cybernetic enhancements were also produced for warfare during this Industrial Cyberware Revolution during the 2010s. The first crucibles that were designed these combat implants was theSecond Central American War, as well as theSecondandThird Corporate War. In theUSthe megacorporation,Militech, enhanced their soldiers enabling their bodies to increase their carrying capacity and direct connections to personal motion trackers and range finders.
An arms race began between private armies that belonged to megacorporations such asArasakathat still continue in 2077. Generation One cyberware is often found in black markets, usually found in the possession of poor citizens who can't afford anything better. Generation One is usually made of metal and plastic.[4]
The cybermedical market started to boom after the wars. The same corporations that would take part in the wars now saw more opportunities to profit from their lines of medical implants. Cyberweapons were also developed during this time due to lack of federal regulation. Following this, antirejection treatments would also be developed in tandem with the rise of the "kitsch" style, Bioware was also developed soon after this as a byproduct of antirejection treatments being made, the primary use being for integrating cybernetics into the human body via artificially grown, enhanced organs and low-impact nanotech. This period of Gen Two development is widely regarded as the "Age of Cyberware".
Generation Two Cyberware are the most common and frequently implanted pieces of cyberware on the street present day, cheap and primarily prioritizing function over form. It's at this time that the Generation One hydraulic and pneumatic pistons were replaced with artificial cybermuscles, allowing for greater actuation and strength overall. Following this, RealSkinn technology would also be developed, almost immediately becoming a status symbol of one's wealth.[4]
With the eventual rise of megacorporations, it was only a matter of time before cyberware saw a massive jump in development, on account of the nearly bottomless pockets of the big name corps. Instigated by the corporate "cold war" arms race, Generation Three Cyberware would be invented by the bright minds of corporate R&D departments. Every corp wanted better, stronger and faster soldiers to ensure the safety and longevity of the company.
Heavy plates of metal would be replaced with lighter carbon fiber and ceramic polymers, concealed subdermal armor and retractable weapons were developed for black ops hit squads and assassins. Bulletproof, Bladeproof and Flameproof RealSkinn armor variants were made during this time as well, and to this day are the most widely used forms of RealSkinn used among corporate security details and military forces. This period also saw the eventual rise of Bioware technology, using artificial biological enhancements rather than cybernetics. Skinweave, Nanosurgeons, Toxin Binders and synaptic upgrades became quite popular for their immunity to EMP attacks, undetectability by the average scanner and lower chances to induce cyberpsychosis. So, even though these new implants are comparatively weaker to their cyberware counterparts, the benefits are immense and often outweigh the negatives.
Corporate agents and spec ops became the most lethal in their careers after the development of Generation Three cyberware, combining bioware and cyberware to became the ultimate killing machines for the Corporate Gods. However, one should be cautious of illicit unapproved bioware, 'lest the uncertified nanobots within eventually begin attacking and destroying your nervous system.[4]
The best, most advanced, designer cyberware comes in two separate categories. The first: bleeding-edge, top-of-the-game, cream-of-the-crop implants and enhancements used by high ranking corporate officials and agents. Upgraded neural processors, netrunning hackware, grade IV Cybereyes and stress analyzers give these folks an edge over their competitors like no other. Layered and hidden with the highest quality RealSkinn available on the market, Generation Four cybernetics truly define a corporate's lifestyle, acting as the finest symbol of status among the company.
No lower in technological complexity, the second category of Generation Four cyberware comes in the form of designer cyberware designed to be quite overtly visible as cyberware rises more and more as a fashion trend among the rich and powerful. This is Neokitsch, substance and style for the one percent. Social elite, corporate heirs, Braindance celebrities and the like. Flowing gold and platinum weaved into highly advanced RealSkinn, cyberlimbs made of pure crystal cultivated on orbital stations, or even going as far as plating themselves with natural wooden tiles costing more than the average lifetime salary in Night City. Purely decorative, Neokitsch Cybernetics are the highest symbol of wealth, power and influence.[4]

[문서 제목: Cyberpsychosis]
출처: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpsychosis
Cyberpsychosisis a mental illness, specifically a dissociative disorder, caused by an overload ofcybernetic augmentationsto the body.
Those afflicted with cyberpsychosis are known as cyberpsychos, individuals who have existing psychopathic tendencies, enhanced by cybernetics, and as a result have lost their sense of identity as a person, either to themselves or others. They come to view regular people and other living things as weak and inferior. With their enhanced physical abilities and complete disregard for life, cyberpsychos are extremely dangerous to anyone that crosses their path. Cyberpsychosis can eventually affect anyone modified with cybernetics, but the less empathetic or psychologically stable a person is, the more susceptible they are to it.[1]
There is no real cure, though treatment is available (see below). The effects are cumulative. A single cyber hand is unlikely to cause cyberpsychosis, but replacement of all four limbs and both eyes could likely start the descent on the slippery slope. The removal of implants can bring a person back to some normalcy, but crossing the line of psychosis will make this measure hardly matter.
Cyberpsychosis symptoms are gradual, ranging from decay of self-preservation, distancing or disregard from friends and family, and poor or impulsive outbursts or acts. They start to identify more with machines than people, and stop doing things that used to give them pleasure (eating, sleeping, socializing, sex, etc). Eventually human interactions become irritating, and this morphs into contempt, and finally violence.[2]Not all cyberpsychos are physically violent. Some have fragmented personalities, some are kleptomaniacs, others are compulsive liars. But violence towards living things, especially people, is most common.[3]
Cyberpsychosis has become a major problem in the technology-saturated world of Cyberpunk. It is actually quite common in manyboostergangs, though fairly rare in polite society. Police departments have heavily armed and armored units, calledpsycho squads, such asMaxTac, that specialize in subduing or killing cyberpsychos. These psycho squads have members of different backgrounds, including former cyberpsychos.
Incidentally the government (and corporations) are not going to wait for you to go over the edge. It is quite common for governments or corporations (often the de-facto government) to track people who are known to install lots ofcyberware. This is another reasonripperdocsexist; not everyone wants to be on a government watch list for cyberpsychosis.
By 2077, the occurrence of cyberpsychosis had markedly decreased due to medical and implant advancements, but people still succumbed to it every day. Practically none survived any encounter with police, which usually applied overwhelming firepower to put down the threat regardless of the circumstances, a tactic which resulted in collateral civilian deaths. An expensive drug called baloperidol was a common treatment for individuals believed to be on the verge of cyberpsychosis, but its effectiveness was questionable. Standard practice for corporations who learned one of their own was becoming cyberpsychotic was to have them isolate themselves away from the public and wait for a corporate medical team to sedate them and transport them to a therapeutic retreat, but unknown to the victims, these medical teams were actually hit squads.[4]
People who are near the edge are politely asked (that is, required) to register as such. A registered cyberpsycho is on something akin to parole. They must attend periodic therapy sessions to keep them human. They have implants to monitor their activity. So long as they don't do anything dangerous, they can go about their lives as normal.
A cyberpsycho who goes over the edge is often killed outright. Cyberpsychos usually have enough implanted hardware to cause significant damage, and are a threat to anyone they come across. Most police departments will not go out of their way to bring in cyberpsychos alive, as attempting to capture them is much more dangerous and puts bystanders' lives at risk.
But if the psycho can be subdued, they will be strapped down and all of their cybernetics deactivated. They are forcibly jacked into a custombraindance, where a cyberpsychologist (sometimes called a psychoshrink) attempts to piece their personality back together.
Over weeks or months, the cyberpsycho gradually regains their humanity. They may even eventually become human enough to install cybernetics again (assuming they are not in prison for crimes committed on their rampage). But they are never really the same again. Mental damage from cyberpsychosis will change aspects of their personality, and follow them their entire lives.

[문서 제목: Braindance]
출처: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Braindance
Abraindance, commonly abbreviated toBD, is a technology that allows to record and play back someone's experience, including their physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts. Braindances were invented byYuriko Sujimotoin 2007, and were heavily used in psychological treatment. Braindances came to be used more commonly for entertainment, and enjoy wide use in theCyberpunkuniverse. Various devices have been developed in order to record, edit, and play back braindances, fromrecorderstoviewerstowreaths.
After the academic experiments that led Sujimoto to invent braindance technology, BD was repurposed for criminal reconditioning and for military simulations with funding from the State of California andMilitech. By 2009, Sujimoto and a penal psychologist called Lassimer foundedBraindance Incorporatedwith government contracts. Soon after, a joint venture between Militech, Braindance Inc., andDiverse Media System(DMS) released an entertainment form of braindance. Public demand for braindance media grew rapidly, and DMS quickly cornered the market by developing "the world's premier editing facilities and the most extensive braindance chip distribution network". Braindance Inc. and Militech continued to be other key manufacturers of braindance chips.[1]
For manyNight Cityresidents, crushing poverty and homelessness are significant and likely inescapable problems. Despite this, most are still entranced by the glitz of showbiz and luxurious lifestyles of the privileged elite. Breakthroughs in neural technology such as BD have paved the way for people to share recordings of their own emotions and personal memories. Other BD productions put actors in staged situations to create false memories. BDs that are simple recordings of a day in the life of the world's biggest and brightest stars are also popular. The ability to "become" a celeb and experience a life of luxury gives many a chance to escape their own miserable reality. As a result, braindance addiction has become an ever-growing problem for the city's poor.[2]
Unedited BD recordings are called virtus in The Street. Unlike commercial BDs, the sensory input and emotions in a virtu are raw and unedited, essentially the real sensations and feelings that were recorded. It is common to record and sell virtus to BD editors so they can scroll these recordings for additional profit.
Illicit BD recordings, also called Extreme Braindances (XBDs), feature gruesome or bizarre scenes, including violence, torture, rape, and even murder. XBDs are created by small teams who kidnap unwilling victims. Some XBDs are recorded from the perspective of the torturer. Other XBDs are from the perspective of the torturee: the virtus of these are often taken from the corpses of the victims. There is a market for both.
XBDs can be found easily in the seedy underbelly of Night City's black market, although sold through secretive dealers.[2]

[문서 제목: Blackwall]
출처: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Blackwall
TheBlackwall(orBlack Wall)[1]is a firewall developed byNetWatch. Located within theNet, it is tasked with keeping rogueAIsfrom breaking through into the rest of cyberspace and wreaking havoc.
The firewall often splits old network systems in half, leading to stories of haunted data.
Ever since theDataKrashcaused byRache Bartmoss, humanity had been forced to sacrifice its access to invaluable resources and knowledge for the safekeeping of theNet.NetWatchtried to regain control against the rogueartificial intelligences, but to no avail. As an alternative, NetWatch — helped by theTranscendentalsand theGhosts— secretly started development in2044of a project called "The Black Wall" in order to keep the Net under control, while permanently sealing off old access nodes into the Net. The Blackwall's task was to secure an area of cyberspace for human use while holding at bay the threat of the dangerous rogue AIs that were released decades earlier into Net.[1][2][3]
By2077, the Blackwall is still active, as the danger of the rogue AIs getting free could possibly cause the end of the world. However, severalnetrunnergroups believe the free AIs will help them conquer the virtual world, and pursued methods on how to destroy the firewall. To ensure this never happens, NetWatch works overtime to keep others from destroying it.
It is revealed by various sources that the Blackwall is not a firewall, but actually a powerful AI masquerading asICE, whose job is to keep out any rogue AIs it can identify from the secure net. It is also referred to as a band-aid solution, since the Blackwall, being an AI, could go rogue itself. TheVoodoo Boysbelieve that outcome is inevitable, and are willing to do anything to remove the Blackwall and win favors with the rogue AIs for when they return.[4]
Other groups of a more elite veneer have also expressed an interest in the Blackwall. The American multinational corporationMilitechin particular sought to reactivate the long-dead ProjectCynosure, itself an early attempt at capturing rogue AIs using adaptive neural networks, to harness the Blackwall for its own ends, particularly to compete withArasaka. The federal government of theNew United Statesalso expressed a disproportionate interest in harnessing the Blackwall through skilled netrunners such asSong So Mi, even though both of these actions would have likely led to another corporate (or global) conflict.
Alt Cunninghamreveals that the best way to survive beyond the Blackwall is by assuming a human form to not turn into pure data, out of animalistic behavior.[5]
Depending on the choices made at the end ofCyberpunk 2077, eitherVorJohnnycan agree to follow Alt beyond the Blackwall, where they will fuse with her like the rest of the constructs fromMikoshi.[5]

[문서 제목: Relic]
출처: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Relic
TheRelicis a series ofArasakabiochips allowing the storage and manifested reading of digitized human psyches known asengrams.
At least two separate versions of the biochip prototype were developed by 2077, according to thesummarized internal reportassembled by the former director of the Relic project,Anders Hellman, upon turning coat for the benefit of Arasaka's rival corporation,Kang Tao.
The first version was intended for the commercial market and advertised as a means for wealthy elites to store their psyche in form of an engram capable of basic communication with their loved ones. The form itself would have consciousness but lack true self-awareness. In spite of its limitations, Relic 1.0 has managed to enter the market and the lives ofNight Cityresidents, giving hope by providing a notion of immortality truly approaching human reach. Arasaka logs on the other hand reveal that the Relic's initial purpose was of a more capitalist nature - usingSoulkilleron celebrities, important cultural icons, and artists in order to create engrams for commercialisation purposes.
The second version of the biochip was a top secret project, personally commissioned and supervised bySaburo Arasaka. It was intended for internal use within the corporation only, never to be sold. Unlike the original biochip, which was only used to communicate with pre-saved engrams with artificially integrated limitations, Relic 2.0 contains a system which was meant to install and activate the engram in a new organic body. The core idea of the project was to implant a digitized psyche into a new host, although only after the body had all neural and cardiac functions terminated, at which point it would automatically expand into the host's brain using nanotechnology. In short, a person who copied their mind onto Relic 2.0 and then died could be restored to life in a new body using the chip, effectively granting them immortality. Internal testing of Relic 2.0 showed promising results, but Arasaka scientists had difficulty preventing the personality construct from becoming emotionally unstable after re-implantation, and the biochip eventually failed in every trial. The Arasaka Corporation also confirmed that Relic 2.0 would not activate if implanted in living individuals who were on the verge of death. The project had not progressed past the trial phase until an unplanned undertaking of the process by a living individual. Examination of the Relic's advancement proved that, despite keeping the subject alive, it was continuing its functional expansion and taking over the motor and psychological functions of the host.
The Relic biochip must be stored and transported in stable thermal conditions and in an appropriate neural environment. Even momentary exposure to temperatures falling outside the recommended range could result in permanent damage to the technology. The state of the art of research on the technology in2077recommended to store the Relic device in Arasaka laboratory-certified isothermal containers to ensure a stable storage temperature within 2-8 degrees Celsius (35.6-46.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
It is easy to discern that a great majority of people, regardless of closeness to theSecure Your Soulprogram, treat the Relic as a device that grants immortality.Hanako Arasakatreats the engram of her father as a real human being and the Relic as a vessel of his consciousness.Yorinobu Arasakapotentially believed that interrupting the Relic project might prevent his father's resurrection.Liam Northom, the manager and lover ofLizzy Wizzy, had plans for making a backup of her own engram and editing it in order to modify her behaviour.
While Anders Hellman himself never treated the biochip as a device that can actually host consciousness, the contract for the repossession of a human "soul" for the Secure Your Soul program signed under his name promises not to make copies of the created engram due to ethical concerns.
Alt Cunningham, explains that, while she exists as an engram, uploaded to the Net, she has no consciousness, effectively functioning as aRogue AI. She adds that, onceJohnny Silverhandsevered the connection between her engram and her consciousness during the 2013 Arasaka raid, the real Alt died along with her organic body. As an untethered AI, Alt is able to read other engrams in their most basic form, so regardless of them potentially experiencing a very human thought process, the raw data that is written this way leaves nothing concealed. On the other hand, theMikoshienvironment allows engrams themselves to interact with one another on a more human level, without the implications of reading each other's thoughts, hence emulating proper conversations.
Similar to all other types of data, engrams can be overwritten with another digitized psyche, which is something Alt offersVas a final solution for their troubles.

V, also known as Valerie or Vincent, represents a significant threat to Arasaka Corporation. After the heist at Konpeki Plaza, V becomes inextricably linked to Arasaka due to the Relic (Biochip) embedded in their head, which contains the engram of Johnny Silverhand. Johnny Silverhand is a rockerboy and terrorist who nuked Arasaka Tower in 2023 and is a sworn enemy of the corporation. V is fighting for survival against the Relic overwriting their consciousness, while Arasaka seeks to recover their property. Hanako Arasaka sees V as a tool to expose Yorinobu Arasaka's crimes (patricide of Saburo Arasaka). Therefore, V's relationship with Arasaka is one of mutual hostility, temporary usage, and existential conflict.
